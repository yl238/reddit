Couldn't attend Live Conversation Test due to family emergency,7,8,2020-09-03 05:46:06,"Hi, has anyone been in a situation where you could not join a live conversation test due to a genuine reason?

I know the rules regarding not showing up for a Live Conversation Test are pretty strict and straightforward - you are rated 1 star.

Question about screening out,0,3,2020-09-03 04:04:05,"I’m wondering if you get screened out if you pick too many options. 

I just had a screener about the types of payment I use and clicked 6 out of the 8 eg apple pay, debit card, cash. 
I answered truthfully but wonder if I chose too many options to be believable.",https://www.reddit.com/r/usertesting/comments/ild59z/question_about_screening_out/
Test in progress even if it’s done,2,12,2020-09-02 23:16:19,"Hi! I recently took the Hearing Loss test and I finished it before going back to my dashboard but it said that the test is still in progress even if it’s not. I read the previous threads about similar cases and the main advice given is to go to the mobile app and cancel it there in order to get new tests. I did that. 

My question is, would I still be paid for the job or not anymore? 

Chrome told me that the test had finished uploaded before I went back to my dashboard so usertesting should have received it. I’m a bit worried.",https://www.reddit.com/r/usertesting/comments/il7l8v/test_in_progress_even_if_its_done/
Increasing problems with reliability,7,11,2020-09-02 19:14:25,"Is anyone else experiencing more and more problems with recording, upload etc?

Over the past few days, the Chrome extension recorder has given me various problems, including fully completing one test and apparently uploading it too, only to return to the dashboard and it say ""Testing in progress"", and eventually receive an email saying I never completed the test.

Similarly, this morning, the Android mobile app allowed me to fully complete a test and upload it, apparently successfully, and then when I return to the mobile dashboard it says ""your test is being processed"", and the PC website says ""testing in progress"".

That's 2 tests in the past 24 hours which I have fully completed and probably won't be paid for. I've reached out to support in both cases, but from past experience, I'm not expecting a response. It's incredibly frustrating to do work that you end up not being paid for, and especially with a lack of support to follow it up and compensate you for it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/usertesting/comments/il44u7/increasing_problems_with_reliability/

Looking for user testers for a DeFi trading bot platform,1,4,2020-08-30 21:12:26,"Hey guys, I run a remote design studio helping teams and companies design and launch new digital products.

We are working on a different product almost every week and test the products with around 5 people each week, looking for testers very short notice.

Each test consists of a **30min interview on a computer (please have a mic and ideally a webcam)** and we compensate it with a **25$ Amazon voucher** (no cash yet due to legal reasons).

This week we are testing a trading bot platform for crypto-assets, the interviews are on Wednesday, **2nd of September.**

**This week I'm looking for people matching the following criteria:**

* you have experience with margin trading, preferably on cryptocurrency exchanges

**I have five slots free so if you would like to participate, please send me a PN with a truthful reply to the following question:**

Usertesting Record stuck at 0:03 mark even if the Test is recordding,0,1,2020-08-30 19:10:51,"Hello all!This is my second month in usertesting. Just a while ago I did a test a bout an online concert. I paused the record for a while and went back on it. I was able to record 0:03 before I paused. When I started the record again, it is stuck at the 0:03 mark.. but the record is still on. I tried to pause and start again but it wouldn't work. So I just neglected it and continued with the test... at the end it was still 0:03 but I completed it and now it's on pending 10$. But I'm afraid it just got the 3 seconds of record even if I actually did the test and I will be getting my first non-five star rating T\_T

Ratings,1,6,2020-08-29 23:15:39,"Hi - question regarding the average rating calculation. 

I know that the average rating is the average of the last 12 rated tests. 

However, does anyone know how ""last 12"" is defined? 

Is it in the order of when tests get rated or is it in the order that the tests were completed?

For example, a test I did 7 days ago was also rated 7 days ago (say I got a 5). Another test that I did 2 months ago was rated 5 days ago (say I got a 4).   
Say hypothetically, since then all my tests were rated and I have obtained another 11 ratings, which means that 1 rating will fall out of the calculation. Which rating will fall out of the average rating calculation? The 5 star rating for the test done 7 days ago and rated 7 days ago or the 4 star rating for the test done 2 months ago but rated 5 days ago?
