Thoughts and Opinions on Userbrain,7,16,8/7/20 19:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/usertesting/comments/i5bltt/thoughts_and_opinions_on_userbrain/,"I'm just trying out different sites similar to usertesting and basically seeing which ones are consistent and nice to do. So currently a consistent one for me is userbrain. After a qualification test, and passing it, it did take a couple of weeks before I actually received any tests, although that may have partially been on my part due to not fully understanding how userbrain worked. So I only do desktop tests since I dont have an iphone with ios 13 meaning that I limit myself to pc only. So how userbrain works on pc is that you download the chrome extension onto chrome and that acts as your notification with a number bubble to indicate you have tests. I may have received some tests before but never noticed this notification so ye. I only noticed it yesterday. So basically my experience with userbrain started yesterday. So I have done 4 tests not including the qualification test. Userbrain pays $3 per test which compared to usertesting is far less and may seem not worth it. But when you add in the fact that each test that you receive is a test that you can do, meaning no needto go through screeners or questions, it means its a guaranteed $3 as long as you do the test and at a standard quality. In terms of quantity, it appears to be in bursts? Like if I get a test now then usually another pops up soon after and then the rest of the time is dead. Of course this is with 2 days worth of experience so it's short sighted. I want to ask on the experience of others.

Here's what happens, When I finish the test and start to upload it using the usertesting app that I recorded it on. The first 50% of the upload goes quickly then every percent afterwards happens every 5-10 minutes which causes the test to timeout and get released to another user tester.

Last week we had numerous tests with poor instructions (not even broke) and I qualified for them (hearing loss) but the instructions were so bad that I couldn't complete them...I reported every one of them with details and nice tone- I was paid $10.00 for 2 of them, $5.00 for 2x of them, and $3.00 for another in keeping with how far I was into the test, within the week. That's $33.00 accumulative for a tests I never got to take. On another platform, where I test AI for smart home, the test, which paid $16.00 was so full of glitch I couldn't complete even one of the tasks; I left detailed info on what was occurring, and they not only said they were going to pay me for that info, but provided a link for the retake at $20.00. That's $36.00 for 20.00 mins of my time. I'm not saying this boastfully. I'm just saying it seems to pay to take a professional approach more often then not, with reliable testing platforms.

The second one just happened this morning with diagnostic products--52 steps!!! I was on minute 15 and step 48 when the app on my phone crashed. No way back into the test. On both occasions I reported to UserTesting, but it seems like for me at least, they've stopped giving out payments even if you're not at fault. I'm not complaining, or whining, this happens to everyone. Just letting you all know that this happens to everyone, and yes, it is incredibly frustrating. Happy Wednesday","Just Need to Vent...

I hope it turns out great!"" at the end of every test. Ever since I started doing that I've gotten three 5 star ratings out of the 27 tests I've taken in the past 30 days, which has been awesome. The majority of my tests are still not rated, but those new three ratings helped to pull my rating back up to where I'd like it to be. I never thought that I'd be excited about an 11% success rate, but here we are.",ratings

Client Wanted A Different Time Zone,4,2,6/17/20 6:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/usertesting/comments/hacxrx/client_wanted_a_different_time_zone/,"Last week I accepted a a live chat for this week. During the screener it mentioned that they would like me to select a time in the time zone of IST (India Standard Time). However when the time came to schedule it, the page clearly said what time I was picking was in Central time (my time zone). Then I got a notification on my dashboard that the test would be at 4 PM Central. 15 minutes before 4 PM Central a ""Join Test"" button would appear. Today I got a message about the test, and they were asking if I was sure that I could be there at 2 PM IST (which was the completely wrong time anyway). 2PM IST would have been about 3:30 in the morning here and I would have just done it if i had to (and if it was ok with UserTesting), which I told them. But I also wrote back to them that the User Testing dashboard gives me a ""join test"" button 15 mins prior to the time it's listing which was 4PM Central. I told them I couldn't see how I could even join a session without that. I was just thinking that doing a live interview with someone without going through the ""join test"" button from UserTesting would probably mean you wouldn't get paid, right? But then I remembered that I got an email that some clients would use other programs than Zoom for live chats in the future, and I went looking around for information on that. I believe you have to click on the ""join test"" button for those though. It doesn't matter now because after I messaged the client I also sent a support ticket into UserTesting and at some point it got cancelled, which I understand. I think it was probably the client who cancelled versus anything done by UserTesting because I didn't receive a response to my message to UT. The client likely didn't understand how that join test button and scheduling thing worked seeing as how they asked people to choose in IST not knowing that the calendar tells you (the tester) what time it is in your time zone. But I was just curious on thoughts about the whole situation, especially seeing as how I haven't heard anything official from UserTesting about it yet.

Tester requires face recording during regular Usertesting test,6,8,5/30/20 4:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/usertesting/comments/gszibv/tester_requires_face_recording_during_regular/,"Hey everyone so I have seen this question asked, although very rarely, during the screener for regular tests (NOT LIVE TESTS) ""Are you comfortable recording your face during this test?"". Today I had a test I passed the screener and one of the questions was the question I stated above, and I said yes. When I started the test it told me to go to [Turncameraon.com](https://Turncameraon.com). So during the recording I went to this website and on my Chrome browser it said ""This site canâ€™t be reached. **turncameraon.com** refused to connect."". During the test I also tried googling it and getting access to the website that way as well and had the same problem (I later tried on my phone and another web browser as well on my computer and they both had the same issue so I know the website was actually not working properly). I ended up reporting and ending the test because the website didn't work. My question here is when you typically use [turncameraon.com](https://turncameraon.com) during a test, will the test recorder even pick up the face recording? I thought that the Usertesting platform recorder is only recording the actual tab you have open that you start the test in. This is because every time I make a new tab or open a link in a new tab that is mentioned during a usertesting test, the recorder button on the top right corner disappears and seems like it does not function when you leave the page. If this is the case how would you be able to complete a test and at the same time show your face recording on another tab. It is a bit confusing and just I want to know if any of you have had experience actually doing this during a test.

There is literally nothing to view or click on. I've tried waiting until it loads completely, tried refreshing multiple times, even copying and pasting in another browser, and nothing. Every time it's blank white. I've also had 3 tests with the IPEVO camera where the screen recorder has totally frozen in the middle of the test. The weird thing about this is that it always freezes at a specific step depending on the test. (I know this because I have exited out of the recorder and opened it again to try to restart the test in case it was just a glitch). For example one time I was doing a longer test that had been reserved for me... I got to step 16 and had been recording for 20 minutes, when I clicked ""Next Task"" and it froze. It freezes so that you cannot even click ""previous"" or ""help"". The only thing I could do was exit completely and separately report a problem. My last frustration is that I have reported these problems every time with screenshots and proof and I have NEVER received a response from Usertesting and I have never been compensated for my time. I'm starting to get really angry. I have been a tester for 5 years and have a 5 star rating... this sort of thing has never happened before, and my requests for help were always answered. The last 10 or more requests I have sent it seems have been totally ignored, and I'm owed about $80 at least for all these technical problems that were not my fault, since Usertesting says that if there's a problem not on the tester's end, you will be compensated for your time. Sorry for the long post but I'm so frustrated. Has anyone else had these problems? Does anyone else feel like they're being purposely ignored by the Usertesting team or are they just that horrible at responding lately?","Prototypes and Links not working, and IPEVO tests freezing HELP Hi, I am getting so frustrated lately... it has been several times now that I begin a test on my iPhone or iPad that requires me to use a prototype or access a link to download or view something, but when this link opens up automatically from Usertesting, it is completely blank and white.

For example one time I was doing a longer test that had been reserved for me... I got to step 16 and had been recording for 20 minutes, when I clicked ""Next Task"" and it froze. It freezes so that you cannot even click ""previous"" or ""help"". The only thing I could do was exit completely and separately report a problem. My last frustration is that I have reported these problems every time with screenshots and proof and I have NEVER received a response from Usertesting and I have never been compensated for my time. I'm starting to get really angry. I have been a tester for 5 years and have a 5 star rating... this sort of thing has never happened before, and my requests for help were always answered. The last 10 or more requests I have sent it seems have been totally ignored, and I'm owed about $80 at least for all these technical problems that were not my fault, since Usertesting says that if there's a problem not on the tester's end, you will be compensated for your time. Sorry for the long post but I'm so frustrated. Has anyone else had these problems? Does anyone else feel like they're being purposely ignored by the Usertesting team or are they just that horrible at responding lately?",bad test

Bonuses still on for going overtime in tests,6,5,5/28/20 1:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/usertesting/comments/grn8le/bonuses_still_on_for_going_overtime_in_tests/,"I was browsing here last week and saw a comment. I can't find it now, but basically it said that if the client doesn't say upfront that they'll pay more for you going overtime then you won't receive compensation for the extra time. The person linked to this article: https://testersupport.usertesting.com/hc/en-us/articles/360030660172-Why-haven-t-I-received-my-bonus-payment- I understand that from that article it sounds like you only get paid for overtime if the client says they will first. However, today I did receive a couple of extra payments for a couple of tests that went overtime from the past. Thankfully the support team is getting a bit better at responding to things than they used to be. I just wanted to let people know that if it does go overtime (not by just a couple of minutes of course, but like 25+ mins on a supposedly 15 minute test) then the client should have booked a 30 min live interview or preemptively said the bonus would be offered for the un-moderated tests if they want that much information and they should be paying more for your time, and so just report it to be compensated for your time. But obviously don't try to drag out a test with unhelpful talk to try to squeeze more money from their clients. I'm sure they review the tests for stuff like that seeing as how all bonus payments are handled manually.","Bonuses still on for going overtime in tests I was browsing here last week and saw a comment.

Today I have done several tests on my laptop again and noticed that each one is causing the same problem to happen. Chrome is unbearably slow/laggy and the fan is blasting like crazy. I have a brand new Macbook pro that has high-performance capabilities (and this does not happen to every test so I know it is more than capable of handling it), I have the most updated google chrome, adblocker, and protection/malware programs on my computer disabled, and my computer is running the newest firmware. Could this be that the simple websites which the tester is directing me to for their specific tests are causing this? For the most part they are just simple websites displaying pictures so I highly doubt that is the case. Has anyone had the same experience and/or know of a solution? Thank you!",other
Doing more screeners before your live interview time slot has finished,3,2,5/22/20 5:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/usertesting/comments/go46bk/doing_more_screeners_before_your_live_interview/,"Hello everyone, I have been doing quite a few of the ""Live Interviews"" on UT, whether that be the 30 or 60-minute time slots, and here is my situation.. I finish many of these interviews 15-20 minutes earlier than what the customer originally bought the time slot for. At that point (after the interview is over but before the official time slot has finished) I go to the UT website I get a message that says something along the lines of ""Your interview is in progress... In order to take another test you must finish the time slot"" and then it gives me the option to either ""Leave Meeting"" or ""Rejoin Meeting"", even though the actual meeting is over Zoom which is a completely different software than what is on the UT website.

The screener questions initially started off with, asking what type of work you do, how many employees, if the business is for profit, what type phone do you use, then started asking all these questions about printers at your workplace, what type, how often you use, which printers would you never consider using etc..

Tips from a researcher,34,16,2/8/20 6:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/usertesting/comments/f0hp0j/tips_from_a_researcher/,"Hi testers! I found this subreddit today after I was looking into why all my participants were using the old desktop version of the UT recorder. Question answered! I'm a User Experience Researcher and I've been using usertesting for work for the last 3 years (mods I'm happy to provide verification if necessary). I just wanted to reach out to the community and say hi! As someone who has watched hundreds of your videos, first off, thank you for taking the time out of your life to do this! Feedback from testers like you all have been invaluable in making big decisions in the companies I've worked for. Your recordings and conversations do make a difference. Big tips from me: The most important thing I'm looking for is **honesty**. In shareouts, I have to tell my colleagues that the usertesting panel is too positive and to take ratings with a grain of salt. Be brutal - if something doesn't make sense to you, you making a point of calling it out can help fix it. If we ask you ""how likely would you be to consider xyz"" or ""how easy or difficult was that task"", rate it with your gut reaction. I'm cheering you guys on to tear stuff apart, because getting validation from testers helps move the needle for change. It also means when you like something, it makes that positive feedback even more compelling. Don't **be afraid to give up**, but **don't give up too easily**. This boils down to trying to imagine yourself completing something in the real world. Before confirming something, you'd probably check and see if you were doing the right thing. You'd also probably not spend 20 minutes trying to figure out something that's inconsequential. You can say ""this is the point where I'd probably give up on this"", and that's ok. The **more you talk, the more I get**. Like in some other threads I've seen on the sub, even if you don't know what to say in the moment, some ""umms"" might get you back to a place where you can think of something to add. Feel free to go ""on a tangent"" about something you see or a task you did if it gets you fired up (good or bad)! My aim is to create tests that are clear and understandable for testers. It doesn't always go perfectly, but I'm not keen on confusing people, or making you spend 30-40 minutes on something. I rate all my participants, and the only people who don't get 5 stars are the ones who clearly aren't trying at all (or the ones who obviously cheated the screener). If you have any questions about my perspective, feel free to leave a comment! I'm also open to feedback as well - I'd love to hear your thoughts about how studies can be improved for you.

I dunno if the Mac desktop app has ridiculous compression or something else but can anyone else confirm their own usual upload sizes? I've emailed support but don't expect to hear back for a while. Also, does anyone else have problems with the chrome extension? I've done all the usual troubleshooting. Thanks fellow testers",recorder

Let's share ackward/funny/annoying things that happened to you while you were doing a tester on Usertesting or a similar site,6,14,12/13/19 6:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/usertesting/comments/e9v10e/lets_share_ackwardfunnyannoying_things_that/,"I thought I would lighten up the mood a bit. I've been doing Usertesting since August and I really enjoy it. I always make sure that I am in a very quiet area where I cannot be disturbed while I am doing the testers or the live chats. Some of these testers are also done at all times of the day even during the middle of the night. There have been instances where no matter how hard I tried, I still could not contain the noise that was coming from elsewhere. For instance, at the beginning, I used to always forget to remove my phone from the computer room while I was doing testers because sure enough I would get a telemarketing call during that time (my bank kept calling to sell me products). I learned to put the phone far away from my computer room which has a door that I can close because it was happening so often. It even happened in the middle of a Live Conversation on Zoom but I apologized and the client did not hold it against me. Another thing I have to do when I suddenly qualify for a tester is to shoo my cats out of the computer room. I have four cats and thankfully Usertesting has a timer before you can start recording because I have to do a quick look around and remove the cats from this location very quickly and they are not too pleased with me (they hang on real tight to this really comfy chair with their claws). A few weeks ago, I had just removed one of my cats from this very particular chair where he was sleeping soundly. It was in the middle of the night and I had just qualified for a tester. My male cat who hardly even moews (the other ones do) decided to start clawing really loudly at my door and meowing like his life depended on it. I was just in the middle of this tester so I had to apologize and tell them that I had to let the cat in the room because he took that one and only time to ""express"" himself loudly at that particular moment. I was so worried that they would hold it against me but they didn't. Also had people knock really loudly at my door and the neighbour decide that 9PM is the right time to start running his chainsaw while I was doing a tester. I did mention it to the client while I was doing the tester and moved on. None of these things were held against me. Just for fun, I am just wondering if you could share any times when you were doing a tester or a live conversation and had ackward/funny/annoying things happen to you. How did you handle it and did the client hold it against you.","Let's share ackward/funny/annoying things that happened to you while you were doing a tester on Usertesting or a similar site I thought I would lighten up the mood a bit.

They rejected my first test and i am waiting for result on my 2nd test for more than a week now. I don't feel like continuing on Validately. Would love to know your opinion on Validately. 3.

I noticed last week that my rating went down a bit but there was nothing different on the main page for my history. I thought perhaps it was a technical glitch since I added up my average and it didn't make any sense.

Just thought you guys might like to know that apparently validately have a recommended internet speed of 30mbps down and 10mbps up to do their tests. I just finished a test with them and the test upload got stuck on 73%. They have a live chat so i talked to their support and he said the upload probably dropped out down the line and asked for my connection speeds, which is 15mb down, 5mb up, to which he immediately replied with a pre-written text saying that they recommend higher speeds or your uploads can ""drop out"". I asked if there was anything that could be done, to re-upload or anything like that and i stated that i've never had any issues before. He just told me i should upgrade my internet and there's no re-upload option, he also said they have different technologies than other sites that require higher speeds and to upgrade. So that was it, test lost. Pretty pissed off about that one to be honest. They should be able to handle an upload dropping out for a second.

[Update] Has anyone completed a test with userfeel?,2,6,10/2/19 23:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/usertesting/comments/dcb4fo/update_has_anyone_completed_a_test_with_userfeel/,"[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/usertesting/comments/d9pj0d/has_anyone_completed_a_test_with_userfeel/) Since we don't get many tests on Userfeel i am updating my experience in case others are interested. So i had 5 tests last week on the 25th that had been pending the whole time until 10 minutes ago when they were approved (8 days in total). They have two ratings it seems, one from the client and one from Userfeel themselves. Not sure of why it takes 8 days to get approved, whether the client just had not seen them until now or if Userfeel wait to approve it themselves after giving the client the test. Just not sure to be honest. Another interesting thing is that once it's approved the money goes into a wallet in your dashboard where you manually withdraw it yourself. They give you the option to withdraw to Visa Debit card, Amazon gift card or simply your Paypal account, which i thought was pretty good to be honest. All in all, it's a bit of a different process to the other UX sites out there i've used, but not too bad of an experience, just a bit of uncertainty while you wait to see if your tests get approved or not. TrymyUi is somewhat similar how they approve your test first before giving it to the client, but from my experience they only take about an hour to approve them, much less 8 days with userfeel. Cheers.","[Update] Has anyone completed a test with userfeel?

What it didn't do was offer a bonus for completion of the over-long tedium, and my experience has been that whatever estimate you're given for how long someone thinks it might take for you to do a 'survey' like that, triple it and that's about the minimum it's really going to take.

Some Generic Tips for Usability Testing,20,16,8/17/19 2:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/usertesting/comments/cra0qu/some_generic_tips_for_usability_testing/,"I thought I'd offer a few tips for those people just starting out. These are just generic tips for usability testing in general and **not** for any specific site. Also, these tips aren't the **ONLY** way to do testing, it's just the way I do it. It's probably common sense to some people too. I have been doing usability testing for a few years now, but got into it pretty heavy about two years ago. I seem to be pretty good at it and I really enjoy doing it. Here is the header from my [usertesting.com](https://usertesting.com) ledger. [https://imgur.com/mz6y07p](https://imgur.com/mz6y07p) I have a 4.9 rating currently. It does go down once in a while and it's been perfect too, but I am always between 4.7 and 5.0. There are 25 completed tests per page and you can see I have 17 pages of completed tests. My last page is almost full, so I am just under 425 total tests done, although some of the moderated and special tests were never in my ledger at all, so I am actually close to 440 completed tests on that site alone... I test for all the other big sites too, so my total usability tests are somewhere around 700. I just offer this info to show that I do have some experience in testing and you can trust what I say to at least work for me. I'm sure there are people with more experience than me and I hope they will offer up some tips here too. 1. **Be honest!** I can't stress this enough. Don't try and say what you think they want to hear. Give honest feedback. if you don't like something, tell them. Don't try and take tests you really aren't qualified to take too. 2. **Be polite!** I always try to put myself in the mind set that I am talking to a good friend about this stuff. I also try and smile while I am doing it. Obviously they can't see you, but I think it comes across in your voice. These people listen to a lot of strangers talking and a monotone/grumpy ass voice can turn them off, even if the person is offering good feedback. 3. **Pay attention!** Read and re-read the instructions out loud. Make sure you understand perfectly what they are asking you. If you don't understand what they are asking, say so and then say ""This is what I \*think\* you mean"" and give feedback on what you think they are asking. Take your time. Never try and speed through the test. The test should be the ONLY thing you are doing too. I once talked to somebody who was upset they received a bad rating on a test, but it was warranted because they were **EATING** while taking the test, lol. 4. **Environment!** Create a space to test in and make it comfortable. Being comfortable also comes across in your voice, more than you would think. Find someplace where you won't be bothered or interrupted in your test. Clients will often give you a low rating if there is a lot of distractions or extra noises in your test audio. Which leads me to my next topic... 5. **Equipment!** When I first started out I was using the internal mic on a laptop. It was ""ok"" most of the time, but I had one client who couldn't understand me at all. It was the only time I ever received a bad rating and [Usertesting.com](https://Usertesting.com) agreed with them. They made me prove the issue was fixed before they let me do any more tests. I bought a mid-range Razer headset and never had issues with sound again. The quality of your audio and video can make or break you. You don't have to spend a ton, but get something half way decent. There is a site who asks you NOT to use a headset though... Userlytics asks that you do not for desktop tests. They said it can somehow interfere, but I have always used a headset with them and have had no issues with sound. YMMV &#x200B; So hopefully these are some helpful hints. I want to reiterate that these tips aren't rules. They are just things that have worked for me and I seem to be pretty successful at usability testing. Each of the sites have their own quirks and rules to follow, so make sure you understand the difference in each place. You also need to find your ""style"" and what works for you the best, for example, I always introduce myself very quickly at the beginning of the test Like *""Hey there, this is Rikostan for* [*Validately.com*](https://Validately.com)*""* only I use my real name. I know a lot of people wouldn't want to use their real name in the test, but it doesn't bother me at all and I feel like it starts off the test on the right foot. &#x200B; Anybody else have some general tips to add? It would be awesome to turn this into a thread for newbies to help them learn how to offer the best feedback possible and get up to speed quickly. &#x200B; &#x200B; {EDIT} I forgot I wanted to also put up a great resource for testers. The /r/beermoney sub has a discord server.

I work from home, so i'm literally at the computer all day so i'm able to click on the screener the second i hear the ding. However, every screener i pass on the PC all result in ""All responses recorded"" no matter how quick i complete the screener. Every. Single. One. All of the time. I only ever get tests on my mobile. What i found interesting though is after i get the 'All responses recorded' message and go back to the dashboard, the test is there and it still gives the option to either decline or take the test. Not ""take screener"", it says ""view test"" and takes you to the test, though still stays all responses recorded. These usually hang around for an hour or so in the dashboard.

I was then able to take the screener which had the exact same questions as one of the screeners i passed on the PC.

Here is a [screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/f6K5L08) from today of three screeners i passed yet remain in the dashboard after i get the ""All responses recorded"" message. What's more interesting is, i got a mobile phone screener show up on the PC dashboard, opened UT app, wouldn't let me continue until i had downloaded and installed the newest usertesting dashboard. I was then able to take the screener which had the exact same questions as one of the screeners i passed on the PC. So even after loading up UT on my phone, having to install the new version, re-opening the app, taking the screener with the same questions, i was able to get the test on the mobile, yet i still can't get a single test on the PC no matter how quick i click it. It's all just starting to seem a bit strange that after all this time (5 weeks since i started) that i can't get one test on the PC after passing so many screeners, yet i get them on the mobile fine. I was thinking about asking support, but wanted to ask everyones opinion here if maybe you had the same thing where the test still hangs around in the dashboard giving the option to take it even though it says ""All responses recorded"" when you do so.",no test

Anytime I actually get to do a test, I have to make them leave my office. When I shut the office door in their face, they always look so sad and it kills me. &#x200B; LOL, yeah, I'm a softy. &#x200B; {EDIT} LOL, it's always weird what people decide to downvote... Nobody else has issues like this when they test?",other
