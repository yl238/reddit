Got $10 pending when I quit a test with no email??,2,11,8/21/20 5:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/usertesting/comments/idhs1d/got_10_pending_when_i_quit_a_test_with_no_email/,"So I was doing a HSBC test, of the mobile app. Halfway through it, it was asking stuff which I wasn't able to do regarding international transfers (the app was broken) so I got frustrated and was about to quit out. However, my internet died just as I was about to quit so I forced closed chrome and everything. 5 minutes later, my internet comes back online and I go straight to Usertesting. The test has finished, and I'm back on the main screen with screeners waiting. To save confusion, it was a desktop test, where I was doing the tasks on my phone. Weird I know but I hope that makes sense. However, I checked my payment pending and it went up by $10, despite the fact I never uploaded the test. Wtf??? It's not showing in my completed tests either. No email from them saying I've been compensated for a failed upload, nothing at all. I'm really confused. I've also got netlimiter installed, so I can see if chrome is uploading. Nothing is uploading so no one has received any form of video. It makes absolutely zero sense.

Thoughts and Opinions on Userbrain,7,16,8/7/20 19:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/usertesting/comments/i5bltt/thoughts_and_opinions_on_userbrain/,"I'm just trying out different sites similar to usertesting and basically seeing which ones are consistent and nice to do. So currently a consistent one for me is userbrain. After a qualification test, and passing it, it did take a couple of weeks before I actually received any tests, although that may have partially been on my part due to not fully understanding how userbrain worked. So I only do desktop tests since I dont have an iphone with ios 13 meaning that I limit myself to pc only. So how userbrain works on pc is that you download the chrome extension onto chrome and that acts as your notification with a number bubble to indicate you have tests. I may have received some tests before but never noticed this notification so ye. I only noticed it yesterday. So basically my experience with userbrain started yesterday. So I have done 4 tests not including the qualification test. Userbrain pays $3 per test which compared to usertesting is far less and may seem not worth it. But when you add in the fact that each test that you receive is a test that you can do, meaning no needto go through screeners or questions, it means its a guaranteed $3 as long as you do the test and at a standard quality. In terms of quantity, it appears to be in bursts? Like if I get a test now then usually another pops up soon after and then the rest of the time is dead. Of course this is with 2 days worth of experience so it's short sighted. I want to ask on the experience of others. Sorry for this long chunk of text.",other,other,other

I was able to do two 30 minute live conversations and one 60 minute conversation. Which helped out a lot. I did have two issues a test didnâ€™t upload. And a test asked for too much information so I exited. Iâ€™m waiting to hear back from support. (I did not include the $20 in my total). Overall Iâ€™m very impressed with the site. The past few days I was out so I havenâ€™t been on the site since Tuesday. I havenâ€™t had much luck with the mobile apps. But on the computer site I was able to pass many of the screeners which was great. I hope it wasnâ€™t beginners luck lol. tldr: I made $140 USD my first 7 days,other,other,other

IPEVO Camera App issue.

Since it has a great community response i thought I would throw another question out there and see if anyone else is having or had this issue in the past. So every time I get a test which requires the IPEVO camera to record my phone regardless of how long the test record for 10 minutes or even 30 minutes it seems the test will always never upload in time before the test is released to another usertester. About 2-3hours. *You get an email warning you about 1.5hours before the test is released.* I never have issues uploaded from my Phone or even using the Browser app when taking a normal test. 45 minute test upload less than 10 minutes, but with the program that uses the IPEVO camera it takes hours to upload a simple 15 minute file. Here's what happens, When I finish the test and start to upload it using the usertesting app that I recorded it on. The first 50% of the upload goes quickly then every percent afterwards happens every 5-10 minutes which causes the test to timeout and get released to another user tester. Quite annoying when you spend quality time giving feedback only to not have it published to the customer. I sometimes have luck after I finish taking my IPEVO test allow it to upload for a minute and cancel the upload. Find the test on my computer and use the Usertesting program that helps you upload test that fails when uploading. This seems to go much quicker sometimes than using the IPEVO usertesting upload process. This makes me think that maybe the program is using an old connected server or something that is congested. Like I said before I never have this issue when uploading a test from my phone or when I take a normal browser test. It's only the IPEVO camera test which upload very slowly. This is my connection speed &#x200B; [Current connection speed](https://preview.redd.it/muw5u323mte51.png?width=350&format=png&auto=webp&s=e67299d4df0d9a7986c3dfe5dfe6109493f64a85) Does anyone else have this issue, and if so how have you corrected it?

Did UT change something regarding Zoom live conversations and their scheduled time limit?,0,2,7/21/20 17:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/usertesting/comments/hv3q16/did_ut_change_something_regarding_zoom_live/,"(Some context: I don't have much experience with live conversations because I rarely do them due to anxiety, but I'm working on improving that every time I get the chance. This one was only the 2nd one I ever did on mobile, I did way more on PC) I just had a mobile Zoom live conversation that was supposed to last 30 minutes. Because I was trying a downloaded prototype app (while sharing my screen) and the app completely covered my screen, I didn't get to see the time on my phone and I didn't pay attention to the running time. I was in the middle of the 7th prototype task when all of sudden my recording was abruptly cut off by UT. I got the exact same message you get when you finish a regular mobile test. The one that says: ""Screen Broadcasting / Live broadcast to UserTesting has stopped due to: Test complete."" I was very confused, I was no longer in the Zoom call, so I tried clicking the ""Join interview"" button sent to my email again... I was sent to a page that said: >**Thank you for speaking with us (my Zoom name)!** > >You did great! Our team may reach out to you as a followup if needed I never got this page before (I was relieved, ngl). I instantly took a screenshot of this message and I noticed that it was exactly 15 minutes after the 30-minute time slot finished. My test wasn't canceled and it's under my pending payments. But I felt so bad because the moderator was so nice and I was literally speaking doing a task when UT cut me off and ended it. I just felt kinda bad because I didn't finish all the tasks they had planned, even though I do realize they should have done a 60-minute one if it was gonna take longer than 30 minutes. And I suppose the clients (in theory) should know that the live test could be abruptly cut off if they overdo the time slot, since they're the ones creating live conversations. I was hoping they would message me something but I got nothing. Definitely am not gonna get a rating for this, which sucks, but anyway... What I want to ask is, is this a recent change? Because I've never had live conversations when it was cut off all of sudden, the client actually had to end the meeting whenever they wanted to. My 1st mobile live conversation and the last two I did on PC went 20-ish minutes longer than the scheduled time. Did UT put a time limit on live tests so that testers don't abuse and use more time than what was scheduled (30 minutes or 60 minutes)? Thank you!",live convo,,live convo

I have an okay wifi connection, more than capable of uploading a 200mb video, but the upload fails every time! Then you have to spam ""retry"" to get it to actually try again. So I use 4G for most of my uploads. Reliable connection, 5mbps up. I go ahead and upload, and it goes really quick, no issues, before failing at a random point throughout. This never used to happen, and once it fails I can't even forego payment, I always get compensation when it doesn't upload but in the email it says "" If you continue to have upload issues in the future you may not be eligible to receive payment. "" which is effectively threatening a ban, so I cannot take mobile tests anymore because I am at extreme risk of getting banned through no fault of my own. I'm not actually able to quit the test once I'm at the upload step, so I can't stop this happening. I'm not risking my account for $10 in compensation, this has happened twice in 24 hours and I know if it happens again I'm out. This will get downvoted to hell because ""ooooo it's your internet! or oooo it's your phone!"". Well: a. it's not my internet (my computer tests, even up to 60 minutes upload just fine!

Why make me type out what I think with a phone keyboard when I can just say it... Finally took a weight off my shoulders and got rid of the app for good.

Conversion Crimes Update.,5,5,6/26/20 9:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/usertesting/comments/hfx744/conversion_crimes_update/,"First off, I want to add a disclaimer here. I have been working as a paid consultant for Conversion Crimes for a very short time now. This is the first post about them I have made since joining the team, but going forward, the fact that I am getting paid as a consultant could possibly color my opinion of the platform, but I'll do my best to not let any bias creep into my posts. I just wanted that out there. Quinn, the founder of CC, just sent out an email a little bit ago, in it she says "" *We are currently training one of YOU guys to be our first tester advocate. They will help us come up with arrangements that work for both parties. I want Conversion Crimes to be the best place for testers to work and itâ€™s a privilege and pleasure to do so. ""* That's me. I am helping to flesh out their moderation team and helping to make sure the new tester onboarding process is strict, but fair, and that it will help people grow their testing skills. I am also one of the liaisons between the testers and the CC team. If you use the ticketing system on the site, it might be me that answers. I am just a tester like the rest of you, so I have a decent understanding of the frustrations and issues a lot of us encounter and I am on your side. &#x200B; CC is a very small team, but very talented and they sincerely want to see people succeed at testing. Having a small but talented group of testers is also still the focus, instead of the massive group of testers Usertesting has. After the beta, when signups open up again, they will only be taking a limited amount of people and you'll need to pass the three short training tests to prove you are either already a good tester, or can take feedback well and grow into one before joining the pool of testers. &#x200B; Also, another reminder, CC is still in Beta and **still not accepting new testers.** &#x200B; **Most of the email Quinn sent out is for tester's eyes only, so if you received it, please do not share the details here!!** There are a couple of things I can share though... Quinn came up with a great way to give an incentive to clients to rate our tests. I think it will make both testers and clients very happy. No details for now, but I think people will really like it and it should lead to having more of your tests fairly rated and feedback given. She also talked about tester notifications coming soon. The bones of it are in place, it just needs some work to finish it off. Lastly she said "" I want customers to know that if you want the most valuable user testing feedback videos - you go to Conversion Crimes. Which means weâ€™re going to be getting more selective and more focused on quality. "" &#x200B; &#x200B; They have a ton of things in the pipeline and some big changes coming very soon, so watch out for posts here and emails from CC directly. &#x200B; Oh yeah, please don't DM here with questions.

We get a lot of repeat questions in this sub, not surprisingly, and most of them are addressed below. *If you post something that is addressed in this faq, your post may be removed.* **MINORS ARE PROHIBITED FROM USING** [**USERTESTING.COM**](https://USERTESTING.COM)**. Do not post in this sub if you are under 18 years old. Stop using usertesting if you are a minor. If your post history shows that you are under 18, your posts will be removed and you will be removed from the sub.** **Alt accounts are not welcome here. We have detected several users with alts and they run the risk of banning.** &#x200B; * **How can I pass the entrance test on the website?** The entrance test on the website is very self-explanatory and you are likely to pass if you follow the instructions. There are no ""tips"" beyond that. &#x200B; * **How long before I'm approved?** If you mean ""I just took the quickie test on the website (currently the Air & Space Museum test)"", you'll be reviewed and approved/denied within a day or two. If approved, you will start seeing screeners soon. If you mean ""I just took my first paid test, how long until I can take more?"" the answer is explained in [the sticky.](https://www.reddit.com/r/usertesting/comments/fz9wai/waiting_for_your_first_paid_test_to_be_approved/) &#x200B; * **Where are all the screeners?Â Why is it so slow?Â It's slow for me -- is it slow for you guys too? I passed the website entrance test but nothing's showing up on my dashboard, how come?** We don't know.Â Some people seem to get a steady stream of them, while for others it's more of a feast-or-famine situation.Â For some, it seems to be famine most of the time. We do seem to know that it's different for everyone.Â *Prevalence of screeners is likely to be based in part on your profile.* Also, North American and UK testers anecdotally seem to see more frequent opportunities than some other parts of the world but again, we're not sure. There doesn't seem to be a predictable time of day that you'll see screeners, but most users report weekends are slower than M-F. You'll see members of the sub posit theories about it all but really we don't know, beyond a belief that your rating may have fallen too low (and we don't have certainty about what constitutes ""too low"", either). Leave your dashboard open and refresh frequently. Screeners may be coming to you, but being snatched up so quickly you're simply not seeing them before they vanish from your dashboard. &#x200B; * **I'm getting plenty of screeners but I'm not passing any of them.Â Why?** Everyone is in the same boat.Â It wouldn't be a surprise to anyone here to learn that you've had 40 screeners and not passed any of them.Â The acceptance rate is low, and that's that.Â The number we've heard thrown around is roughly 5% but that's an estimate.Â Â  Many screeners are looking for a very specific demographic and that seems to contribute to the low acceptance rate. Frustrating, yes, but if you think about it, if the screeners were less specific, you *still* probably wouldn't get to test because then everybody would be eligible to pass the screener so the test would fill up quickly. &#x200B; * **How many tests do you guys typically get in a day/week/month?** Some people get multiple tests a day, some people report an average of one a day, and some report a few a month, as well as every other possible answer. It's going to vary wildly based on your particular particulars and what some other testers get is no indication of any kind that you will get a similar number. &#x200B; * **I passed a screener (""Success!""), clicked Accept the Test, and was taken to a page that says All Responses Recorded.Â What happened?** Probably, the seats got filled in the moment it took your Accept response to transmit.Â This is super common. There are cases, though, where something else happens and it's a glitch.Â If you get the All Responses Recorded response, make sure you do not click the Available Tests tab across the top of the dashboard.Â Instead, click the gray button to the right that says Back to Dashboard (or maybe Return to Dashboard?Â I can't remember).Â On rare occasion, you'll be returned to a page that says you're mid-test, and it provides a link to rejoin your test.Â I thought it was only I that that has happened to be recently others posted the same thing has happened to them. The above scenario is extremely rare, though.Â It's vastly more likely that you missed it by *that* much, due to high competition for tests. &#x200B; * **When can I expect to see ratings? Why are most of my tests not getting rated?** UT's customers are the ones providing ratings, and it's totally at their discretion whether they will rate your test or not. People here in the sub report < 5% of their tests get rated. When you do get a rating, it is usually, but not always, within a week. &#x200B; * **I emailed UT support about a problem but haven't heard back. And/or, I got a 1-star rating but UT hasn't reviewed it yet. What gives/How long does it take to hear from support?** Nobody knows when or if UT support will respond to inquiries or review bad ratings. They seem to be chronically backlogged. Some people report quick turnaround and others say that support requests just go into an abyss and are never responded to. &#x200B; * **Why am I not hearing a ding? I only hear a ding sometimes and I think it's broken.** Many people have this issue. The ding is unreliable. Work around by refreshing often. &#x200B; * **Live Conversations: what can I expect?** We have had a ton of people ask this. Sift through [these](https://www.reddit.com/r/usertesting/search?q=live%20conversation&restrict_sr=1) search results to see what has been said in the past. &#x200B; * **I got a bunch of emails from UT saying ""New Feedback Request from UserTesting"". What is this??** OK so not everybody seems to get these, and some people get them a lot while others get them sporadically. They're simply email invites to take the same screeners that show up on your dashboard. They're an irritant more than anything else, because by the time you receive and read the email and click on the included link, the screener will almost certainly be gone. I delete them when I see them in my inbox. &#x200B; * **What are some other testing sites?** [Here you go.](https://www.reddit.com/r/usertesting/comments/c0aj24/user_testing_sites/) &#x200B; * **Advice to succeed:** Do the Â [recommended tutorials](https://app.usertesting.com/my_dashboard/success_center) on the website.Â They're very thorough and they do a good job of preparing you, especially in preparing you for encountering a problem while testing. Knowing the difference between Report a Problem and Quit Test is important.Â  Do not lie when taking screeners.Â Do not try to game them.Â It's not worth a possible ban.Â Accept that you won't pass most of the screeners, just like the rest of us don't pass most of the screeners. &#x200B; * **How to be a good citizen in this sub:** Please search before asking. Please follow sub rules shown in the sidebar. Do not use [usertesting.com](https://usertesting.com) or post in this subreddit if you are under 18. If someone is being a jerk, *make sure to report them*.Â If they're being a jerk in a way that's not expressly spelled out in the rules, report them using Custom Response as your reason.Â We want to establish a civil community and get rid of the rudeness. Take what you read in this sub with a grain of salt.Â Not everybody knows what they're talking about. Don't ask for or provide advice about cheating the usertesting system. ***Don't claim certainty when it comes to how things work at UT.***Â You may think you understand the workings of UT but you probably don't.Â It's fine to share your beliefs but express them as such.Â ""I think they \_\_\_\_"", ""My guess is \_\_\_\_"" are preferable to ""They do it that way because \_\_\_\_\_"", for example.Â **In this way we hope to slow the transmission of rumor or supposition as certainty.** \[Examples: Don't state as fact that using a VPN will get you banned.

Client Wanted A Different Time Zone,4,2,6/17/20 6:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/usertesting/comments/hacxrx/client_wanted_a_different_time_zone/,"Last week I accepted a a live chat for this week. During the screener it mentioned that they would like me to select a time in the time zone of IST (India Standard Time). However when the time came to schedule it, the page clearly said what time I was picking was in Central time (my time zone). Then I got a notification on my dashboard that the test would be at 4 PM Central. 15 minutes before 4 PM Central a ""Join Test"" button would appear. Today I got a message about the test, and they were asking if I was sure that I could be there at 2 PM IST (which was the completely wrong time anyway). 2PM IST would have been about 3:30 in the morning here and I would have just done it if i had to (and if it was ok with UserTesting), which I told them. But I also wrote back to them that the User Testing dashboard gives me a ""join test"" button 15 mins prior to the time it's listing which was 4PM Central. I told them I couldn't see how I could even join a session without that. I was just thinking that doing a live interview with someone without going through the ""join test"" button from UserTesting would probably mean you wouldn't get paid, right? But then I remembered that I got an email that some clients would use other programs than Zoom for live chats in the future, and I went looking around for information on that. I believe you have to click on the ""join test"" button for those though. It doesn't matter now because after I messaged the client I also sent a support ticket into UserTesting and at some point it got cancelled, which I understand. I think it was probably the client who cancelled versus anything done by UserTesting because I didn't receive a response to my message to UT. The client likely didn't understand how that join test button and scheduling thing worked seeing as how they asked people to choose in IST not knowing that the calendar tells you (the tester) what time it is in your time zone. But I was just curious on thoughts about the whole situation, especially seeing as how I haven't heard anything official from UserTesting about it yet.

Did I play this out wrong? Is there a way you can actually completely close the tab and the entire browser and then open it back up after to continue the test?",other,,other

Similar test,6,4,5/30/20 14:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/usertesting/comments/gt93f1/similar_test/,"Hi, I'm relatively new to usertesting, so please be kind =) Appreciate all constructive advice. I recently did 2 tests that were very similar. The screeners were the same and I got accepted for both tests. The website was the same but the first task for the second test was not the same as the first task for the first test and so I kept on going, thinking that the second test would be different to the first and that they must have improved something on the test or the webpage between the first test and the second test, otherwise I shouldn't have gotten through. Turns out that the tasks done for both were the same but the order in which they asked the tasks to be performed were different. However when I look back at ""Completed Tests"", the task details for both were the same (and in the same order), even though when I did the second test, I swear the order of the tasks were different and the screen recording should prove that. In the second test, I also took a different route to perform some of the tasks and actually found a broken link in the webpage, which I did not find in the first test. The tests were done 4 hours apart and had completely different test numbers. I read now on this subreddit that I should have reported and quit the second test, but as I found the broken link and also as the task order for the second test was different to the first (which made me think the tests were different), I kept on going and the second test was submitted. So what should I do now? Should I be proactive and write to Support and ask them to invalidate my second test? I am ok to miss out on the $10 for the second test even though I did find the broken link. I'd rather not get a bad rating because of this. As I am new, I am currently on 4.3 with 5, 5 and 3. A bad rating will put me below 4, which I believe will limit my chances of getting other tests. Of course I will learn from learn from this experience but appreciate any constructive advice that you have. Thanks!",ratings,,ratings

For Validately specifically, which I used to have a great experience with (got an average of maybe 3 or 4 $10 studies and 1 longer $30/70 live study per week), I wonder if I was flagged as such. I no longer get *any* emails from them since the end of March. And I kinda miss them lol. I'm surprised only because I've been personally told on several occasions by Validately researchers and even the coordinator there that my usertesting was very helpful, thorough, and critical, all of which which I try to be. And yes, I was honst on the screeners. I may reach out to Validately to see what I can do to work with them again. I may have just taken too many studies, or my demographic has been oversaturated?

Tester requires face recording during regular Usertesting test,6,8,5/30/20 4:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/usertesting/comments/gszibv/tester_requires_face_recording_during_regular/,"Hey everyone so I have seen this question asked, although very rarely, during the screener for regular tests (NOT LIVE TESTS) ""Are you comfortable recording your face during this test?"". Today I had a test I passed the screener and one of the questions was the question I stated above, and I said yes. When I started the test it told me to go to [Turncameraon.com](https://Turncameraon.com). So during the recording I went to this website and on my Chrome browser it said ""This site canâ€™t be reached. **turncameraon.com** refused to connect."". During the test I also tried googling it and getting access to the website that way as well and had the same problem (I later tried on my phone and another web browser as well on my computer and they both had the same issue so I know the website was actually not working properly). I ended up reporting and ending the test because the website didn't work. My question here is when you typically use [turncameraon.com](https://turncameraon.com) during a test, will the test recorder even pick up the face recording? I thought that the Usertesting platform recorder is only recording the actual tab you have open that you start the test in. This is because every time I make a new tab or open a link in a new tab that is mentioned during a usertesting test, the recorder button on the top right corner disappears and seems like it does not function when you leave the page. If this is the case how would you be able to complete a test and at the same time show your face recording on another tab. It is a bit confusing and just I want to know if any of you have had experience actually doing this during a test. Thanks!",bad test,,bad test

There is literally nothing to view or click on. I've tried waiting until it loads completely, tried refreshing multiple times, even copying and pasting in another browser, and nothing. Every time it's blank white. I've also had 3 tests with the IPEVO camera where the screen recorder has totally frozen in the middle of the test. The weird thing about this is that it always freezes at a specific step depending on the test. (I know this because I have exited out of the recorder and opened it again to try to restart the test in case it was just a glitch). For example one time I was doing a longer test that had been reserved for me... I got to step 16 and had been recording for 20 minutes, when I clicked ""Next Task"" and it froze. It freezes so that you cannot even click ""previous"" or ""help"". The only thing I could do was exit completely and separately report a problem. My last frustration is that I have reported these problems every time with screenshots and proof and I have NEVER received a response from Usertesting and I have never been compensated for my time. I'm starting to get really angry. I have been a tester for 5 years and have a 5 star rating... this sort of thing has never happened before, and my requests for help were always answered. The last 10 or more requests I have sent it seems have been totally ignored, and I'm owed about $80 at least for all these technical problems that were not my fault, since Usertesting says that if there's a problem not on the tester's end, you will be compensated for your time.

Bonuses still on for going overtime in tests,6,5,5/28/20 1:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/usertesting/comments/grn8le/bonuses_still_on_for_going_overtime_in_tests/,"I was browsing here last week and saw a comment.

However, today I did receive a couple of extra payments for a couple of tests that went overtime from the past. Thankfully the support team is getting a bit better at responding to things than they used to be. I just wanted to let people know that if it does go overtime (not by just a couple of minutes of course, but like 25+ mins on a supposedly 15 minute test) then the client should have booked a 30 min live interview or preemptively said the bonus would be offered for the un-moderated tests if they want that much information and they should be paying more for your time, and so just report it to be compensated for your time. But obviously don't try to drag out a test with unhelpful talk to try to squeeze more money from their clients.

Macbook Pro running very hot/fan blasting with Chrome super laggy and slow during tests,3,4,5/22/20 6:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/usertesting/comments/go5kw4/macbook_pro_running_very_hotfan_blasting_with/,"Hey everyone, I have noticed that occasionally when I would run a test on my Macbook Pro I would get some tests that would almost immediately after opening the recorder cause my Google Chrome to be running extremely slow/laggy and within a few seconds my computer gets extremely hot and the fan starts blasting. This has significantly impacted my testing experience and I'm sure the customer's listening experience in regards to my recording. I am trying to figure out why this happens. It used to happen a few weeks ago and I found that disabling my Adblocker on Google Chrome made it stop for the most part. Today I have done several tests on my laptop again and noticed that each one is causing the same problem to happen. Chrome is unbearably slow/laggy and the fan is blasting like crazy. I have a brand new Macbook pro that has high-performance capabilities (and this does not happen to every test so I know it is more than capable of handling it), I have the most updated google chrome, adblocker, and protection/malware programs on my computer disabled, and my computer is running the newest firmware. Could this be that the simple websites which the tester is directing me to for their specific tests are causing this? For the most part they are just simple websites displaying pictures so I highly doubt that is the case. Has anyone had the same experience and/or know of a solution? Thank you!",other,,other
Doing more screeners before your live interview time slot has finished,3,2,5/22/20 5:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/usertesting/comments/go46bk/doing_more_screeners_before_your_live_interview/,"Hello everyone, I have been doing quite a few of the ""Live Interviews"" on UT, whether that be the 30 or 60-minute time slots, and here is my situation.. I finish many of these interviews 15-20 minutes earlier than what the customer originally bought the time slot for. At that point (after the interview is over but before the official time slot has finished) I go to the UT website I get a message that says something along the lines of ""Your interview is in progress... In order to take another test you must finish the time slot"" and then it gives me the option to either ""Leave Meeting"" or ""Rejoin Meeting"", even though the actual meeting is over Zoom which is a completely different software than what is on the UT website. If I want to at this point do more screeners during the time after I finished my interview (but before my time slot has finished) am I out of luck? Or would ""Leave meeting"" be the option to choose here? I don't want to experiment with it and then not get credit for the live interview. Currently I have just been waiting for the time slot to finish in order to play it safe and then get more screeners. Please let me know if anyone has experience with this.

I have been experiencing an issue where the screener progresses onto the next question following a successful response for the previous question however then the overlap pop of unfortunately you didn't qualify for this study appears. Usually it appears where it goes blank with no questions in the background. I have managed to capture a screenshot for illustration purposes I have also reported it to UT back in March I haven't received a response touchwood. It is rather infuriating because I am all too aware that I have selected the correct responses and it hasn't screened me out it has happened on multiple tests I am wondering if anyone else has encountered a similar issue on the iPhone app. (it exclusively occurs on the iPhone - never on any other device) https://preview.redd.it/vwaapbbm6wy41.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=23afddb61a9fa91d55d50a342388712f5980bbbe",mobile,,mobile
