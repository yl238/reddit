Also in order to record my voice to verify that my mic works, usertesting made me download another third party app. Instead of using their own app (that they also made me download) which already HAS voice recording capabilities.

Got $10 pending when I quit a test with no email??,2,11,8/21/20 5:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/usertesting/comments/idhs1d/got_10_pending_when_i_quit_a_test_with_no_email/,"So I was doing a HSBC test, of the mobile app. Halfway through it, it was asking stuff which I wasn't able to do regarding international transfers (the app was broken) so I got frustrated and was about to quit out. However, my internet died just as I was about to quit so I forced closed chrome and everything. 5 minutes later, my internet comes back online and I go straight to Usertesting. The test has finished, and I'm back on the main screen with screeners waiting. To save confusion, it was a desktop test, where I was doing the tasks on my phone. Weird I know but I hope that makes sense. However, I checked my payment pending and it went up by $10, despite the fact I never uploaded the test. Wtf??? It's not showing in my completed tests either. No email from them saying I've been compensated for a failed upload, nothing at all. I'm really confused. I've also got netlimiter installed, so I can see if chrome is uploading. Nothing is uploading so no one has received any form of video. It makes absolutely zero sense. Usually if I get compensated for internet failure or something I get an email from UT support (bot) telling me.

Thoughts and Opinions on Userbrain,7,16,8/7/20 19:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/usertesting/comments/i5bltt/thoughts_and_opinions_on_userbrain/,"I'm just trying out different sites similar to usertesting and basically seeing which ones are consistent and nice to do. So currently a consistent one for me is userbrain. After a qualification test, and passing it, it did take a couple of weeks before I actually received any tests, although that may have partially been on my part due to not fully understanding how userbrain worked. So I only do desktop tests since I dont have an iphone with ios 13 meaning that I limit myself to pc only. So how userbrain works on pc is that you download the chrome extension onto chrome and that acts as your notification with a number bubble to indicate you have tests. I may have received some tests before but never noticed this notification so ye. I only noticed it yesterday. So basically my experience with userbrain started yesterday. So I have done 4 tests not including the qualification test. Userbrain pays $3 per test which compared to usertesting is far less and may seem not worth it. But when you add in the fact that each test that you receive is a test that you can do, meaning no needto go through screeners or questions, it means its a guaranteed $3 as long as you do the test and at a standard quality. In terms of quantity, it appears to be in bursts? Like if I get a test now then usually another pops up soon after and then the rest of the time is dead. Of course this is with 2 days worth of experience so it's short sighted. I want to ask on the experience of others. Sorry for this long chunk of text.",other

Since it has a great community response i thought I would throw another question out there and see if anyone else is having or had this issue in the past. So every time I get a test which requires the IPEVO camera to record my phone regardless of how long the test record for 10 minutes or even 30 minutes it seems the test will always never upload in time before the test is released to another usertester. About 2-3hours. *You get an email warning you about 1.5hours before the test is released.* I never have issues uploaded from my Phone or even using the Browser app when taking a normal test. 45 minute test upload less than 10 minutes, but with the program that uses the IPEVO camera it takes hours to upload a simple 15 minute file. Here's what happens, When I finish the test and start to upload it using the usertesting app that I recorded it on. The first 50% of the upload goes quickly then every percent afterwards happens every 5-10 minutes which causes the test to timeout and get released to another user tester. Quite annoying when you spend quality time giving feedback only to not have it published to the customer. I sometimes have luck after I finish taking my IPEVO test allow it to upload for a minute and cancel the upload. Find the test on my computer and use the Usertesting program that helps you upload test that fails when uploading. This seems to go much quicker sometimes than using the IPEVO usertesting upload process. This makes me think that maybe the program is using an old connected server or something that is congested. Like I said before I never have this issue when uploading a test from my phone or when I take a normal browser test. It's only the IPEVO camera test which upload very slowly. This is my connection speed &#x200B; [Current connection speed](https://preview.redd.it/muw5u323mte51.png?width=350&format=png&auto=webp&s=e67299d4df0d9a7986c3dfe5dfe6109493f64a85) Does anyone else have this issue, and if so how have you corrected it?

This one was only the 2nd one I ever did on mobile, I did way more on PC) I just had a mobile Zoom live conversation that was supposed to last 30 minutes. Because I was trying a downloaded prototype app (while sharing my screen) and the app completely covered my screen, I didn't get to see the time on my phone and I didn't pay attention to the running time. I was in the middle of the 7th prototype task when all of sudden my recording was abruptly cut off by UT. I got the exact same message you get when you finish a regular mobile test. The one that says: ""Screen Broadcasting / Live broadcast to UserTesting has stopped due to: Test complete."" I was very confused, I was no longer in the Zoom call, so I tried clicking the ""Join interview"" button sent to my email again... I was sent to a page that said: >**Thank you for speaking with us (my Zoom name)!** > >You did great! Our team may reach out to you as a followup if needed I never got this page before (I was relieved, ngl). I instantly took a screenshot of this message and I noticed that it was exactly 15 minutes after the 30-minute time slot finished. My test wasn't canceled and it's under my pending payments. But I felt so bad because the moderator was so nice and I was literally speaking doing a task when UT cut me off and ended it. I just felt kinda bad because I didn't finish all the tasks they had planned, even though I do realize they should have done a 60-minute one if it was gonna take longer than 30 minutes. And I suppose the clients (in theory) should know that the live test could be abruptly cut off if they overdo the time slot, since they're the ones creating live conversations. I was hoping they would message me something but I got nothing. Definitely am not gonna get a rating for this, which sucks, but anyway... What I want to ask is, is this a recent change? Because I've never had live conversations when it was cut off all of sudden, the client actually had to end the meeting whenever they wanted to. My 1st mobile live conversation and the last two I did on PC went 20-ish minutes longer than the scheduled time. Did UT put a time limit on live tests so that testers don't abuse and use more time than what was scheduled (30 minutes or 60 minutes)? Thank you!",live convo

That's $33.00 accumulative for a tests I never got to take. On another platform, where I test AI for smart home, the test, which paid $16.00 was so full of glitch I couldn't complete even one of the tasks; I left detailed info on what was occurring, and they not only said they were going to pay me for that info, but provided a link for the retake at $20.00. That's $36.00 for 20.00 mins of my time. I'm not saying this boastfully. I'm just saying it seems to pay to take a professional approach more often then not, with reliable testing platforms.

I solved the ""processing"" video thing by the looks of things, well it hasn't occurred for a while, doesn't mean I've fixed it. Regardless, next problem is now I can't upload anything at all. I have an okay wifi connection, more than capable of uploading a 200mb video, but the upload fails every time! Then you have to spam ""retry"" to get it to actually try again. So I use 4G for most of my uploads. Reliable connection, 5mbps up. I go ahead and upload, and it goes really quick, no issues, before failing at a random point throughout. This never used to happen, and once it fails I can't even forego payment, I always get compensation when it doesn't upload but in the email it says "" If you continue to have upload issues in the future you may not be eligible to receive payment. "" which is effectively threatening a ban, so I cannot take mobile tests anymore because I am at extreme risk of getting banned through no fault of my own. I'm not actually able to quit the test once I'm at the upload step, so I can't stop this happening. I'm not risking my account for $10 in compensation, this has happened twice in 24 hours and I know if it happens again I'm out. This will get downvoted to hell because ""ooooo it's your internet! or oooo it's your phone!"". Well: a. it's not my internet (my computer tests, even up to 60 minutes upload just fine!

""She lied. She had not used the app before."" &#x200B; First, I am a male. Second, the screener asked if you had used the app before (which I had) and how many times (which I put down as once in the past year). I am furious.

Text boxes during tests?,7,3,6/29/20 3:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/usertesting/comments/hhjdyu/text_boxes_during_tests/,"This has bothered me for over a year and so I figured I would ask you all about it. How do you handle text boxes during tests? Do you just type your answer to the question silently? Or do you attempt to type and talk at the same time? Usually what I do is I say, ""I'm going to type my answer first, then talk about it."" I quickly write a succinct answer to the question, and then verbally provide more details. I'm a slow typer and I also make more mistakes when I am attempting to type and talk at the same time, so these parts of tests always stress me out.",other

Conversion Crimes Update.,5,5,6/26/20 9:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/usertesting/comments/hfx744/conversion_crimes_update/,"First off, I want to add a disclaimer here. I have been working as a paid consultant for Conversion Crimes for a very short time now. This is the first post about them I have made since joining the team, but going forward, the fact that I am getting paid as a consultant could possibly color my opinion of the platform, but I'll do my best to not let any bias creep into my posts. I just wanted that out there. Quinn, the founder of CC, just sent out an email a little bit ago, in it she says "" *We are currently training one of YOU guys to be our first tester advocate. They will help us come up with arrangements that work for both parties. I want Conversion Crimes to be the best place for testers to work and itâ€™s a privilege and pleasure to do so. ""* That's me. I am helping to flesh out their moderation team and helping to make sure the new tester onboarding process is strict, but fair, and that it will help people grow their testing skills. I am also one of the liaisons between the testers and the CC team. If you use the ticketing system on the site, it might be me that answers. I am just a tester like the rest of you, so I have a decent understanding of the frustrations and issues a lot of us encounter and I am on your side. &#x200B; CC is a very small team, but very talented and they sincerely want to see people succeed at testing. Having a small but talented group of testers is also still the focus, instead of the massive group of testers Usertesting has. After the beta, when signups open up again, they will only be taking a limited amount of people and you'll need to pass the three short training tests to prove you are either already a good tester, or can take feedback well and grow into one before joining the pool of testers. &#x200B; Also, another reminder, CC is still in Beta and **still not accepting new testers.** &#x200B; **Most of the email Quinn sent out is for tester's eyes only, so if you received it, please do not share the details here!!** There are a couple of things I can share though... Quinn came up with a great way to give an incentive to clients to rate our tests. I think it will make both testers and clients very happy. No details for now, but I think people will really like it and it should lead to having more of your tests fairly rated and feedback given. She also talked about tester notifications coming soon. The bones of it are in place, it just needs some work to finish it off. Lastly she said "" I want customers to know that if you want the most valuable user testing feedback videos - you go to Conversion Crimes. Which means weâ€™re going to be getting more selective and more focused on quality. "" &#x200B; &#x200B; They have a ton of things in the pipeline and some big changes coming very soon, so watch out for posts here and emails from CC directly. &#x200B; Oh yeah, please don't DM here with questions.

We get a lot of repeat questions in this sub, not surprisingly, and most of them are addressed below. *If you post something that is addressed in this faq, your post may be removed.* **MINORS ARE PROHIBITED FROM USING** [**USERTESTING.COM**](https://USERTESTING.COM)**. Do not post in this sub if you are under 18 years old. Stop using usertesting if you are a minor. If your post history shows that you are under 18, your posts will be removed and you will be removed from the sub.** **Alt accounts are not welcome here. We have detected several users with alts and they run the risk of banning.** &#x200B; * **How can I pass the entrance test on the website?** The entrance test on the website is very self-explanatory and you are likely to pass if you follow the instructions. There are no ""tips"" beyond that. &#x200B; * **How long before I'm approved?** If you mean ""I just took the quickie test on the website (currently the Air & Space Museum test)"", you'll be reviewed and approved/denied within a day or two. If approved, you will start seeing screeners soon. If you mean ""I just took my first paid test, how long until I can take more?"" the answer is explained in [the sticky.](https://www.reddit.com/r/usertesting/comments/fz9wai/waiting_for_your_first_paid_test_to_be_approved/) &#x200B; * **Where are all the screeners?Â Why is it so slow?Â It's slow for me -- is it slow for you guys too? I passed the website entrance test but nothing's showing up on my dashboard, how come?** We don't know.Â Some people seem to get a steady stream of them, while for others it's more of a feast-or-famine situation.Â For some, it seems to be famine most of the time. We do seem to know that it's different for everyone.Â *Prevalence of screeners is likely to be based in part on your profile.* Also, North American and UK testers anecdotally seem to see more frequent opportunities than some other parts of the world but again, we're not sure. There doesn't seem to be a predictable time of day that you'll see screeners, but most users report weekends are slower than M-F. You'll see members of the sub posit theories about it all but really we don't know, beyond a belief that your rating may have fallen too low (and we don't have certainty about what constitutes ""too low"", either). Leave your dashboard open and refresh frequently. Screeners may be coming to you, but being snatched up so quickly you're simply not seeing them before they vanish from your dashboard. &#x200B; * **I'm getting plenty of screeners but I'm not passing any of them.Â Why?** Everyone is in the same boat.Â It wouldn't be a surprise to anyone here to learn that you've had 40 screeners and not passed any of them.Â The acceptance rate is low, and that's that.Â The number we've heard thrown around is roughly 5% but that's an estimate.Â Â  Many screeners are looking for a very specific demographic and that seems to contribute to the low acceptance rate. Frustrating, yes, but if you think about it, if the screeners were less specific, you *still* probably wouldn't get to test because then everybody would be eligible to pass the screener so the test would fill up quickly. &#x200B; * **How many tests do you guys typically get in a day/week/month?** Some people get multiple tests a day, some people report an average of one a day, and some report a few a month, as well as every other possible answer. It's going to vary wildly based on your particular particulars and what some other testers get is no indication of any kind that you will get a similar number. &#x200B; * **I passed a screener (""Success!""), clicked Accept the Test, and was taken to a page that says All Responses Recorded.Â What happened?** Probably, the seats got filled in the moment it took your Accept response to transmit.Â This is super common. There are cases, though, where something else happens and it's a glitch.Â If you get the All Responses Recorded response, make sure you do not click the Available Tests tab across the top of the dashboard.Â Instead, click the gray button to the right that says Back to Dashboard (or maybe Return to Dashboard?Â I can't remember).Â On rare occasion, you'll be returned to a page that says you're mid-test, and it provides a link to rejoin your test.Â I thought it was only I that that has happened to be recently others posted the same thing has happened to them. The above scenario is extremely rare, though.Â It's vastly more likely that you missed it by *that* much, due to high competition for tests. &#x200B; * **When can I expect to see ratings? Why are most of my tests not getting rated?** UT's customers are the ones providing ratings, and it's totally at their discretion whether they will rate your test or not. People here in the sub report < 5% of their tests get rated. When you do get a rating, it is usually, but not always, within a week. &#x200B; * **I emailed UT support about a problem but haven't heard back. And/or, I got a 1-star rating but UT hasn't reviewed it yet. What gives/How long does it take to hear from support?** Nobody knows when or if UT support will respond to inquiries or review bad ratings. They seem to be chronically backlogged. Some people report quick turnaround and others say that support requests just go into an abyss and are never responded to. &#x200B; * **Why am I not hearing a ding? I only hear a ding sometimes and I think it's broken.** Many people have this issue. The ding is unreliable. Work around by refreshing often. &#x200B; * **Live Conversations: what can I expect?** We have had a ton of people ask this. Sift through [these](https://www.reddit.com/r/usertesting/search?q=live%20conversation&restrict_sr=1) search results to see what has been said in the past. &#x200B; * **I got a bunch of emails from UT saying ""New Feedback Request from UserTesting"". What is this??** OK so not everybody seems to get these, and some people get them a lot while others get them sporadically. They're simply email invites to take the same screeners that show up on your dashboard. They're an irritant more than anything else, because by the time you receive and read the email and click on the included link, the screener will almost certainly be gone. I delete them when I see them in my inbox. &#x200B; * **What are some other testing sites?** [Here you go.](https://www.reddit.com/r/usertesting/comments/c0aj24/user_testing_sites/) &#x200B; * **Advice to succeed:** Do the Â [recommended tutorials](https://app.usertesting.com/my_dashboard/success_center) on the website.Â They're very thorough and they do a good job of preparing you, especially in preparing you for encountering a problem while testing. Knowing the difference between Report a Problem and Quit Test is important.Â  Do not lie when taking screeners.Â Do not try to game them.Â It's not worth a possible ban.Â Accept that you won't pass most of the screeners, just like the rest of us don't pass most of the screeners. &#x200B; * **How to be a good citizen in this sub:** Please search before asking. Please follow sub rules shown in the sidebar. Do not use [usertesting.com](https://usertesting.com) or post in this subreddit if you are under 18. If someone is being a jerk, *make sure to report them*.Â If they're being a jerk in a way that's not expressly spelled out in the rules, report them using Custom Response as your reason.Â We want to establish a civil community and get rid of the rudeness. Take what you read in this sub with a grain of salt.Â Not everybody knows what they're talking about. Don't ask for or provide advice about cheating the usertesting system. ***Don't claim certainty when it comes to how things work at UT.***Â You may think you understand the workings of UT but you probably don't.Â It's fine to share your beliefs but express them as such.Â ""I think they \_\_\_\_"", ""My guess is \_\_\_\_"" are preferable to ""They do it that way because \_\_\_\_\_"", for example.Â **In this way we hope to slow the transmission of rumor or supposition as certainty.** \[Examples: Don't state as fact that using a VPN will get you banned.

Client Wanted A Different Time Zone,4,2,6/17/20 6:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/usertesting/comments/hacxrx/client_wanted_a_different_time_zone/,"Last week I accepted a a live chat for this week. During the screener it mentioned that they would like me to select a time in the time zone of IST (India Standard Time). However when the time came to schedule it, the page clearly said what time I was picking was in Central time (my time zone). Then I got a notification on my dashboard that the test would be at 4 PM Central. 15 minutes before 4 PM Central a ""Join Test"" button would appear. Today I got a message about the test, and they were asking if I was sure that I could be there at 2 PM IST (which was the completely wrong time anyway). 2PM IST would have been about 3:30 in the morning here and I would have just done it if i had to (and if it was ok with UserTesting), which I told them. But I also wrote back to them that the User Testing dashboard gives me a ""join test"" button 15 mins prior to the time it's listing which was 4PM Central. I told them I couldn't see how I could even join a session without that. I was just thinking that doing a live interview with someone without going through the ""join test"" button from UserTesting would probably mean you wouldn't get paid, right? But then I remembered that I got an email that some clients would use other programs than Zoom for live chats in the future, and I went looking around for information on that. I believe you have to click on the ""join test"" button for those though. It doesn't matter now because after I messaged the client I also sent a support ticket into UserTesting and at some point it got cancelled, which I understand. I think it was probably the client who cancelled versus anything done by UserTesting because I didn't receive a response to my message to UT. The client likely didn't understand how that join test button and scheduling thing worked seeing as how they asked people to choose in IST not knowing that the calendar tells you (the tester) what time it is in your time zone. But I was just curious on thoughts about the whole situation, especially seeing as how I haven't heard anything official from UserTesting about it yet.

I recently did 2 tests that were very similar. The screeners were the same and I got accepted for both tests. The website was the same but the first task for the second test was not the same as the first task for the first test and so I kept on going, thinking that the second test would be different to the first and that they must have improved something on the test or the webpage between the first test and the second test, otherwise I shouldn't have gotten through. Turns out that the tasks done for both were the same but the order in which they asked the tasks to be performed were different. However when I look back at ""Completed Tests"", the task details for both were the same (and in the same order), even though when I did the second test, I swear the order of the tasks were different and the screen recording should prove that. In the second test, I also took a different route to perform some of the tasks and actually found a broken link in the webpage, which I did not find in the first test. The tests were done 4 hours apart and had completely different test numbers. I read now on this subreddit that I should have reported and quit the second test, but as I found the broken link and also as the task order for the second test was different to the first (which made me think the tests were different), I kept on going and the second test was submitted. So what should I do now? Should I be proactive and write to Support and ask them to invalidate my second test?

You name it, I guess I've done it at this point lol My question is, you do see on the screeners and on the dashboard to be truthful and honest, and if you aren't, and you're found out, you'll be banned or removed from the site in some way. For Validately specifically, which I used to have a great experience with (got an average of maybe 3 or 4 $10 studies and 1 longer $30/70 live study per week), I wonder if I was flagged as such. I no longer get *any* emails from them since the end of March. And I kinda miss them lol. I'm surprised only because I've been personally told on several occasions by Validately researchers and even the coordinator there that my usertesting was very helpful, thorough, and critical, all of which which I try to be. And yes, I was honst on the screeners. I may reach out to Validately to see what I can do to work with them again. I may have just taken too many studies, or my demographic has been oversaturated?

Tester requires face recording during regular Usertesting test,6,8,5/30/20 4:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/usertesting/comments/gszibv/tester_requires_face_recording_during_regular/,"Hey everyone so I have seen this question asked, although very rarely, during the screener for regular tests (NOT LIVE TESTS) ""Are you comfortable recording your face during this test?"". Today I had a test I passed the screener and one of the questions was the question I stated above, and I said yes. When I started the test it told me to go to [Turncameraon.com](https://Turncameraon.com). So during the recording I went to this website and on my Chrome browser it said ""This site canâ€™t be reached. **turncameraon.com** refused to connect."". During the test I also tried googling it and getting access to the website that way as well and had the same problem (I later tried on my phone and another web browser as well on my computer and they both had the same issue so I know the website was actually not working properly). I ended up reporting and ending the test because the website didn't work. My question here is when you typically use [turncameraon.com](https://turncameraon.com) during a test, will the test recorder even pick up the face recording? I thought that the Usertesting platform recorder is only recording the actual tab you have open that you start the test in. This is because every time I make a new tab or open a link in a new tab that is mentioned during a usertesting test, the recorder button on the top right corner disappears and seems like it does not function when you leave the page. If this is the case how would you be able to complete a test and at the same time show your face recording on another tab. It is a bit confusing and just I want to know if any of you have had experience actually doing this during a test. Thanks!",bad test

There is literally nothing to view or click on. I've tried waiting until it loads completely, tried refreshing multiple times, even copying and pasting in another browser, and nothing. Every time it's blank white. I've also had 3 tests with the IPEVO camera where the screen recorder has totally frozen in the middle of the test. The weird thing about this is that it always freezes at a specific step depending on the test. (I know this because I have exited out of the recorder and opened it again to try to restart the test in case it was just a glitch). For example one time I was doing a longer test that had been reserved for me... I got to step 16 and had been recording for 20 minutes, when I clicked ""Next Task"" and it froze. It freezes so that you cannot even click ""previous"" or ""help"". The only thing I could do was exit completely and separately report a problem. My last frustration is that I have reported these problems every time with screenshots and proof and I have NEVER received a response from Usertesting and I have never been compensated for my time. I'm starting to get really angry. I have been a tester for 5 years and have a 5 star rating... this sort of thing has never happened before, and my requests for help were always answered. The last 10 or more requests I have sent it seems have been totally ignored, and I'm owed about $80 at least for all these technical problems that were not my fault, since Usertesting says that if there's a problem not on the tester's end, you will be compensated for your time.

However, today I did receive a couple of extra payments for a couple of tests that went overtime from the past. Thankfully the support team is getting a bit better at responding to things than they used to be. I just wanted to let people know that if it does go overtime (not by just a couple of minutes of course, but like 25+ mins on a supposedly 15 minute test) then the client should have booked a 30 min live interview or preemptively said the bonus would be offered for the un-moderated tests if they want that much information and they should be paying more for your time, and so just report it to be compensated for your time. But obviously don't try to drag out a test with unhelpful talk to try to squeeze more money from their clients.

I finish many of these interviews 15-20 minutes earlier than what the customer originally bought the time slot for. At that point (after the interview is over but before the official time slot has finished) I go to the UT website I get a message that says something along the lines of ""Your interview is in progress... In order to take another test you must finish the time slot"" and then it gives me the option to either ""Leave Meeting"" or ""Rejoin Meeting"", even though the actual meeting is over Zoom which is a completely different software than what is on the UT website. If I want to at this point do more screeners during the time after I finished my interview (but before my time slot has finished) am I out of luck? Or would ""Leave meeting"" be the option to choose here? I don't want to experiment with it and then not get credit for the live interview. Currently I have just been waiting for the time slot to finish in order to play it safe and then get more screeners. Please let me know if anyone has experience with this. I would typically ask UT Support this question but they are backlogged for a while with issues due to the whole coronavirus situation, so I want to ask you all. Thanks!",other

Twenty minutes before the interview I'm on the homepage waiting for the test invite link to pop up and all of a sudden the reminder isn't there anymore and the interviewer never sent me the link. I immediately contacted support (which I guess I'll hear back in the next 12 months). Meanwhile, I passed a screener for a regular test. When I started the test it said to click on the link to start my camera because they wanted to see me as I answered the questions (creepy).

If we ask you ""how likely would you be to consider xyz"" or ""how easy or difficult was that task"", rate it with your gut reaction. I'm cheering you guys on to tear stuff apart, because getting validation from testers helps move the needle for change. It also means when you like something, it makes that positive feedback even more compelling. Don't **be afraid to give up**, but **don't give up too easily**. This boils down to trying to imagine yourself completing something in the real world. Before confirming something, you'd probably check and see if you were doing the right thing. You'd also probably not spend 20 minutes trying to figure out something that's inconsequential. You can say ""this is the point where I'd probably give up on this"", and that's ok. The **more you talk, the more I get**. Like in some other threads I've seen on the sub, even if you don't know what to say in the moment, some ""umms"" might get you back to a place where you can think of something to add. Feel free to go ""on a tangent"" about something you see or a task you did if it gets you fired up (good or bad)! My aim is to create tests that are clear and understandable for testers. It doesn't always go perfectly, but I'm not keen on confusing people, or making you spend 30-40 minutes on something. I rate all my participants, and the only people who don't get 5 stars are the ones who clearly aren't trying at all (or the ones who obviously cheated the screener). If you have any questions about my perspective, feel free to leave a comment! I'm also open to feedback as well - I'd love to hear your thoughts about how studies can be improved for you. Thanks!",test strategy

Then I bought a new tablet, and I tried to download the app and install it on my tablet. I was presented with an introduction page that would not let me log in. It ONLY asked for my email address, and I put that in and then it brings me to a page that says ""Welcome to the Dynamics panel by Microsoft - Business Applications Group"" and attempts to get me to create a new account. If I enter my information, like first name, last name and email address, etc. it tells me my PayPal email is already taken. Of course, it is taken by my account. But since I can't log into my account and it's trying to create a new one it thinks I'm inputting someone else's PayPal email. I was able to continue to do tests on my phone app though. But last week I somehow got logged out of my phone app and now I get the same screen (no way to log in). So now I can't take tests on my phone or tablet (unless I create a new account for each one I suppose... I don't really want to create that many PayPal email addresses). I tried contacting UserTesting support, both on Facebook and through the website, but their initial response was just 1) I need to enter my email and password to log in (nope) or 2) something is wrong with my password (nope). It just never asks me to log in to my account. I am hoping the long response I'm waiting on for my second email to support is because they're looking into this as an app issue and not as user error. But I was kind of shocked to not see anyone else having an issue. I didn't know there was a reddit for this so maybe someone can help me out here. I am using a file that ends in 4.21.2694.apk and I assume that might be the version number. I'm using a Samsung Tab A and Samsung Galaxy Phone. I took a photo of the log in screen than I get here: https://postimg.cc/ZB8JHbPM The the next page after I put in my email that asks for information looks like this: https://postimg.cc/4n18cYHh That's where it is trying to set up an account rather than log me in. Maybe there is an older version of the app I could use? But then if I remember correctly they used to make me update before I could take tests, so I think really it just needs to be updated.

Let's share ackward/funny/annoying things that happened to you while you were doing a tester on Usertesting or a similar site,6,14,12/13/19 6:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/usertesting/comments/e9v10e/lets_share_ackwardfunnyannoying_things_that/,"I thought I would lighten up the mood a bit. I've been doing Usertesting since August and I really enjoy it. I always make sure that I am in a very quiet area where I cannot be disturbed while I am doing the testers or the live chats. Some of these testers are also done at all times of the day even during the middle of the night. There have been instances where no matter how hard I tried, I still could not contain the noise that was coming from elsewhere. For instance, at the beginning, I used to always forget to remove my phone from the computer room while I was doing testers because sure enough I would get a telemarketing call during that time (my bank kept calling to sell me products). I learned to put the phone far away from my computer room which has a door that I can close because it was happening so often. It even happened in the middle of a Live Conversation on Zoom but I apologized and the client did not hold it against me. Another thing I have to do when I suddenly qualify for a tester is to shoo my cats out of the computer room. I have four cats and thankfully Usertesting has a timer before you can start recording because I have to do a quick look around and remove the cats from this location very quickly and they are not too pleased with me (they hang on real tight to this really comfy chair with their claws). A few weeks ago, I had just removed one of my cats from this very particular chair where he was sleeping soundly. It was in the middle of the night and I had just qualified for a tester. My male cat who hardly even moews (the other ones do) decided to start clawing really loudly at my door and meowing like his life depended on it. I was just in the middle of this tester so I had to apologize and tell them that I had to let the cat in the room because he took that one and only time to ""express"" himself loudly at that particular moment. I was so worried that they would hold it against me but they didn't. Also had people knock really loudly at my door and the neighbour decide that 9PM is the right time to start running his chainsaw while I was doing a tester. I did mention it to the client while I was doing the tester and moved on. None of these things were held against me. Just for fun, I am just wondering if you could share any times when you were doing a tester or a live conversation and had ackward/funny/annoying things happen to you. How did you handle it and did the client hold it against you.",other

a warning regarding validately's moderated tests,11,4,11/1/19 4:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/usertesting/comments/dpttzq/a_warning_regarding_validatelys_moderated_tests/,"validately has a HUGE security issue. if you have a mod test and the researcher is still live with the previous participant, you will be able to see and hear both once you click your link. i was able to see the last 3 minutes of another participant's camera (though not see his screen nor interact with them). when i was my time i told the researcher and he said he was going to report this to validately. i had my test (30 min) normally without issues then. the problem is that the researcher contacted validately and told them my answers might have been biased due to the issue. so basically the researcher stabbed me behind the back, took my answers and attempted to get another participant while not paying for my time. validately took this as an offense (from me!) and banned me from the platform due to ""non-professionalism conduct"" on my behalf. in reality, i got banned because i made the company look bad due to this severe security flaw. however the next day they said that they would pay me anyway (after saying that they wouldn't) and after a week of emails or twitter i got unbanned but they didn't acknowledge that this was entirely their fault, instead just saying that they take their researcher's complaints very seriously. so, TL;DR if you have a mod test and you join and experience this, they want you to IMMEDIATELY close the tab without speaking/writing anything on the chat. the problem is that if you see someone on the webcam, you have no way to know if they are the researcher or another participant.",other company

So i had 5 tests last week on the 25th that had been pending the whole time until 10 minutes ago when they were approved (8 days in total). They have two ratings it seems, one from the client and one from Userfeel themselves. Not sure of why it takes 8 days to get approved, whether the client just had not seen them until now or if Userfeel wait to approve it themselves after giving the client the test. Just not sure to be honest. Another interesting thing is that once it's approved the money goes into a wallet in your dashboard where you manually withdraw it yourself. They give you the option to withdraw to Visa Debit card, Amazon gift card or simply your Paypal account, which i thought was pretty good to be honest. All in all, it's a bit of a different process to the other UX sites out there i've used, but not too bad of an experience, just a bit of uncertainty while you wait to see if your tests get approved or not. TrymyUi is somewhat similar how they approve your test first before giving it to the client, but from my experience they only take about an hour to approve them, much less 8 days with userfeel.

Starting with one of the obnoxious screener types wanting to know: * my gender * my role in household financial decision making * whether or not I'd participated in a focus group or one-on-one interview in the past six months * whether or not I worked in certain disqualifying industries (ie. marketing) * whether or not I have a credit card * who it's from * how much I charge to it every month * whether or not I pay it off in full every month * whether or not I'm comfortable with my current balance * what my credit score is From there, I'm offered the test where it is explained to me that they are looking for feedback on e-mails that they send to customers. ""10 e-mails with 20 questions on each, some of which will require you to explain your answer."" I guess in all fairness they did warn that it would take 45-60 minutes for the test. What it didn't do was offer a bonus for completion of the over-long tedium, and my experience has been that whatever estimate you're given for how long someone thinks it might take for you to do a 'survey' like that, triple it and that's about the minimum it's really going to take. (Unless you're rushing, not reading questions properly, and generally not doing a good job.) I stopped to consider whether I wanted to do the test and then follow up with UT for increased payment, but then I realized that for that kind of test, it could go the exact opposite way. Imagine I only get through half the test when I run out of time and end up with a 1- or 2-star rating for not completing it. As a matter of principle, I don't let people take advantage of me, and I don't put myself in a position where I end up worse off for doing what is asked of me within the restrictions imposed by someone else. I feel as though they're putting more attention into how to write a good e-mail than they did in their security systems. For 193 tasks on a 1 hour time limit and no promise of a bonus, about all I'd be willing to do for them is let them kiss my ass. (In general, I don't name names when discussing a test, but this one felt borderline abusive and I think a certain amount of shame attached to the company is warranted.)",bad test

Conversion Crimes Update.,9,47,9/25/19 22:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/usertesting/comments/d93o43/conversion_crimes_update/,"There is a video under Updates if you already have an account, but here is a summary for those people who didn't get in during the open registrations. [https://conversioncrimes.com](https://conversioncrimes.com) &#x200B; First off, they are shooting for a November go-live. They mentioned that they are a very small team of only 8 people and they have another company that is actually their main focus right now, so please be patient. Next they talked about opening up registrations because they need more testers with some specific skills and also because once you take a test for a domain, you can't take the test again if it's been tweaked. They said that they are **not** going to implement any type of screener system at all, but if there are special requirements listed, they expect us to follow those and only take tests we are qualified to take. If you take tests you are not qualified to take and the client complains, there will be consequences. If you do it often, you could lose your account or at the very least get a low rating or not get paid for the test at all. They also talked about having more in-depth and higher paying tests in the future. Something that takes a lot more effort, but also pays more. Then they talked about opening up other avenues for us to earn, like helping them moderate tests. That would entail listening/watching to tests other testers have completed and looking at 5 star tests to see if they warrant a bonus, or tests rated less than two stars, you'd see if it warranted that rating. Obviously this would only be for people who had an aptitude for it and proved the ability to do this task. They also said we could possibly become test writers. When they let us test the other side of it a couple of months ago, they were surprised by how good some of our tests were. So there are some avenues for making money other than just testing.",other company

So qualification seems not always been tested or looked at compared to the actual test, also evidently from some pics here (likes ones that did not do their qualification vetting and says ""select this to move on""). So the question is, do you know if the customers care what you select or do they only view your video? Because a lot of times, selection criteria seems so arbitrary or irrelevant to the actual test",screeners

It's the same as when you have a screener but there is no screener listed there.

This is an unpaid recruitment survey to pre-qualify for more paid tests"". Though it doesn't show anything on my PC dashboard, as seen in the image i posted above. When the unpaid recruitment survey disappears from my phone dashboard, the dashboard on my PC returns to normal as well and i get the ""Keep this page open and listen for the ding that tells you we have a new opportunity for you."" message.

Some Generic Tips for Usability Testing,20,16,8/17/19 2:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/usertesting/comments/cra0qu/some_generic_tips_for_usability_testing/,"I thought I'd offer a few tips for those people just starting out. These are just generic tips for usability testing in general and **not** for any specific site. Also, these tips aren't the **ONLY** way to do testing, it's just the way I do it. It's probably common sense to some people too. I have been doing usability testing for a few years now, but got into it pretty heavy about two years ago. I seem to be pretty good at it and I really enjoy doing it. Here is the header from my [usertesting.com](https://usertesting.com) ledger. [https://imgur.com/mz6y07p](https://imgur.com/mz6y07p) I have a 4.9 rating currently. It does go down once in a while and it's been perfect too, but I am always between 4.7 and 5.0. There are 25 completed tests per page and you can see I have 17 pages of completed tests. My last page is almost full, so I am just under 425 total tests done, although some of the moderated and special tests were never in my ledger at all, so I am actually close to 440 completed tests on that site alone... I test for all the other big sites too, so my total usability tests are somewhere around 700. I just offer this info to show that I do have some experience in testing and you can trust what I say to at least work for me. I'm sure there are people with more experience than me and I hope they will offer up some tips here too. 1. **Be honest!** I can't stress this enough. Don't try and say what you think they want to hear. Give honest feedback. if you don't like something, tell them. Don't try and take tests you really aren't qualified to take too. 2. **Be polite!** I always try to put myself in the mind set that I am talking to a good friend about this stuff. I also try and smile while I am doing it. Obviously they can't see you, but I think it comes across in your voice. These people listen to a lot of strangers talking and a monotone/grumpy ass voice can turn them off, even if the person is offering good feedback. 3. **Pay attention!** Read and re-read the instructions out loud. Make sure you understand perfectly what they are asking you. If you don't understand what they are asking, say so and then say ""This is what I \*think\* you mean"" and give feedback on what you think they are asking. Take your time. Never try and speed through the test. The test should be the ONLY thing you are doing too. I once talked to somebody who was upset they received a bad rating on a test, but it was warranted because they were **EATING** while taking the test, lol. 4. **Environment!** Create a space to test in and make it comfortable. Being comfortable also comes across in your voice, more than you would think. Find someplace where you won't be bothered or interrupted in your test. Clients will often give you a low rating if there is a lot of distractions or extra noises in your test audio. Which leads me to my next topic... 5. **Equipment!** When I first started out I was using the internal mic on a laptop. It was ""ok"" most of the time, but I had one client who couldn't understand me at all. It was the only time I ever received a bad rating and [Usertesting.com](https://Usertesting.com) agreed with them. They made me prove the issue was fixed before they let me do any more tests. I bought a mid-range Razer headset and never had issues with sound again. The quality of your audio and video can make or break you. You don't have to spend a ton, but get something half way decent. There is a site who asks you NOT to use a headset though... Userlytics asks that you do not for desktop tests. They said it can somehow interfere, but I have always used a headset with them and have had no issues with sound. YMMV &#x200B; So hopefully these are some helpful hints. I want to reiterate that these tips aren't rules. They are just things that have worked for me and I seem to be pretty successful at usability testing. Each of the sites have their own quirks and rules to follow, so make sure you understand the difference in each place. You also need to find your ""style"" and what works for you the best, for example, I always introduce myself very quickly at the beginning of the test Like *""Hey there, this is Rikostan for* [*Validately.com*](https://Validately.com)*""* only I use my real name. I know a lot of people wouldn't want to use their real name in the test, but it doesn't bother me at all and I feel like it starts off the test on the right foot. &#x200B; Anybody else have some general tips to add? It would be awesome to turn this into a thread for newbies to help them learn how to offer the best feedback possible and get up to speed quickly. &#x200B; &#x200B; {EDIT} I forgot I wanted to also put up a great resource for testers. The /r/beermoney sub has a discord server. [https://discord.gg/bEJq8TX](https://discord.gg/bEJq8TX) There is a channel called ""Tasks"" there that has a ton of great info about Usability testing and other forms of online jobs.

However, every screener i pass on the PC all result in ""All responses recorded"" no matter how quick i complete the screener. Every. Single. One. All of the time. I only ever get tests on my mobile. What i found interesting though is after i get the 'All responses recorded' message and go back to the dashboard, the test is there and it still gives the option to either decline or take the test. Not ""take screener"", it says ""view test"" and takes you to the test, though still stays all responses recorded. These usually hang around for an hour or so in the dashboard.

Yesterday I finished a test and when it sent me back to the home page, there was absolutely nothing. It's been stuck on a ""Welcome! We look forward to hearing what you have to say. Keep this page open and listen for the ding that tells you we have a new opportunity for you."" for probably 15 hours at this point.

I sent an email to report the test as i felt it took way too long without being notified of extra time or being offered an additional payment. I really did feel i completed the test at very reasonable speed and in no way was i trying to be flaky by reporting it. Usertesting got back to me today, upon reviewing the test they were very nice and thanked me for letting them know and paid me additional compensation to reflect the extra time it took($10). I kind of feel bad if UT had to front the cost and not the client(Not sure who had to pay), but at the end of the day i think it was the right thing to report it.",bad test

I'm early 30's, male, married, work full time, dog, cat etc I'm at the computer all day so i see pretty much see every screener come in. Last week after getting my first test with usertesting passed, my screeners went crazy, i counted 104 screeners in total last week. I got one interview out of those screeners the rest i DQ'd on. I did pick up one mobile test a couple days ago, but it didn't have a screener so i guess i was just lucky. But since that last mobile test (got rated 5 stars, i have 4.5 avg now), the screeners dropped off dramatically, i understand the weekends are slow, but today i never got one screener at all after being so busy with them last week. I've had a similar experiences with TryMyUi and Validately. Before completing my first test with TryMyUi,i had lots of screeners, after my first test(4 stars) they just stopped. Same with validately, got a screener every hour with them until i done my first two tests (got them the same day), screeners went from every hour to maybe one a day, now i don't get any at all for maybe the last 1.5 - 2 weeks. I thought i must have bombed the screeners so i contacted them to ask and they said i had a really good rating and probably the tests just don't fit my demographics. But then how come i was getting a screener every hour prior? Userfeel, i did the qualifier and scored a 5/5 but my overall rating was 2.5, so i was never getting tests. I emailed them to ask about the 2.5 rating and they said it was a mistake and adjusted it to 5/5. Still now having a 5/5 overall rating i have never received a screener to date. userlytics, nothing ever. Intellzoon, nothing ever. Userbrain, nothing ever.
