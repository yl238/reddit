542,No response from support for 7 weeks. What to do?,4,3,1/11/20 1:35,"So back in November I spent about 20 minutes on a test, got to the last question that wasn't formatted correctly by the client. There were three radio buttons on the last question, but no text for the answers, and I couldn't get the Next button to activate. As a result I had to quit the test, and report the error to support. After 4 weeks, I added a comment to my open ticket asking for status, and did the same on their Twitter account, but still no response. Am I just out $10 at this point? Or am I impatient? I don't think I've ever waited this long for a response from any company's support queue before.",bad test

Now I want to get more into it, but all of my tests have a screener. I work as a personal trainer for my normal gig, so my schedule isnâ€™t really 9-5; I have a lot of awkward breaks throughout the day. So my question is: if I take a screener, should I be ready to complete the task at the time of completion? Or will it put the test on my dashboard and I can finish it later?

Currently 55$ us converts to 71.66 cdn...but since I'm forced to use paypal for most of these usertesting sites, 55$ us converts to 69.21 cdn on paypal, and of course I've been through this many times, so the fees are adding up. Anyone else had luck using a different way, or a method I haven't heard of before....I saw something about using an international card to accept the us dollars, but it wasn't available in Canada yet! Also that first trick I talked about is harder to access now, or paypal is getting better at hiding that option now...lol, crappy website. Thank you!

679,[Update] Has anyone completed a test with userfeel?,2,6,10/2/19 23:41,"[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/usertesting/comments/d9pj0d/has_anyone_completed_a_test_with_userfeel/) Since we don't get many tests on Userfeel i am updating my experience in case others are interested. So i had 5 tests last week on the 25th that had been pending the whole time until 10 minutes ago when they were approved (8 days in total). They have two ratings it seems, one from the client and one from Userfeel themselves. Not sure of why it takes 8 days to get approved, whether the client just had not seen them until now or if Userfeel wait to approve it themselves after giving the client the test. Just not sure to be honest. Another interesting thing is that once it's approved the money goes into a wallet in your dashboard where you manually withdraw it yourself. They give you the option to withdraw to Visa Debit card, Amazon gift card or simply your Paypal account, which i thought was pretty good to be honest. All in all, it's a bit of a different process to the other UX sites out there i've used, but not too bad of an experience, just a bit of uncertainty while you wait to see if your tests get approved or not. TrymyUi is somewhat similar how they approve your test first before giving it to the client, but from my experience they only take about an hour to approve them, much less 8 days with userfeel.

I asked if there was anything that could be done, to re-upload or anything like that and i stated that i've never had any issues before. He just told me i should upgrade my internet and there's no re-upload option, he also said they have different technologies than other sites that require higher speeds and to upgrade. So that was it, test lost. Pretty pissed off about that one to be honest. They should be able to handle an upload dropping out for a second.

676,[UserTesting] Be careful how many support tickets you generate if you want the fastest response time.,3,2,10/5/19 0:18,"This is just a PSA to those of you who submit support tickets fairly regularly that UT support appears to be set up so that submitting a ticket when you've already got one or more in the queue moves all of them to the back of the line. I had a technical issue with a test that I reported along with another follow-up ticket with a solution a few days later, followed by an issue with another test almost two weeks after that and all three of them were responded to this morning at essentially the same time. There's no rule or reason to say you can't have multiple tickets active, just ask yourself if submitting another while you've already got one or more in the queue is worth everything going to the back of the line. You'll get a faster response if you don't submit tickets over every minor occurrence.",other

I have gone through the full audio troubleshooting guide and this hasn't solved it. On my last test I ran the screencast-o-matic while starting the test and I got zero background noise through that but my test was still supposedly unusable due to background noise?

643,a warning regarding validately's moderated tests,11,4,11/1/19 4:57,"validately has a HUGE security issue. if you have a mod test and the researcher is still live with the previous participant, you will be able to see and hear both once you click your link. i was able to see the last 3 minutes of another participant's camera (though not see his screen nor interact with them). when i was my time i told the researcher and he said he was going to report this to validately. i had my test (30 min) normally without issues then. the problem is that the researcher contacted validately and told them my answers might have been biased due to the issue. so basically the researcher stabbed me behind the back, took my answers and attempted to get another participant while not paying for my time. validately took this as an offense (from me!) and banned me from the platform due to ""non-professionalism conduct"" on my behalf. in reality, i got banned because i made the company look bad due to this severe security flaw. however the next day they said that they would pay me anyway (after saying that they wouldn't) and after a week of emails or twitter i got unbanned but they didn't acknowledge that this was entirely their fault, instead just saying that they take their researcher's complaints very seriously. so, TL;DR if you have a mod test and you join and experience this, they want you to IMMEDIATELY close the tab without speaking/writing anything on the chat. the problem is that if you see someone on the webcam, you have no way to know if they are the researcher or another participant.",other company

I had an entire page of testers not rated and the few that were rated before that were mostly 4 star ratings (at the very beginning in August when I first registered and was still learning the ropes) so when I started getting 5 star ratings, I was so excited. I noticed last week that my rating went down a bit but there was nothing different on the main page for my history. I thought perhaps it was a technical glitch since I added up my average and it didn't make any sense. I received the email this morning and they said they agreed with the client and voided my payment. Have any of you gotten a one star rating and did it affect how many screeners you were receiving. I made a lot of money so far with Usertesting which I am grateful for but now I am a bit discouraged. I do follow the client's instructions as per recommended but for this one, I actually was quite careful but now I am doubting myself. I am just hoping that some clients give me more 5 star ratings but just getting rated by the client is challenging.

Also, I have tried Validately, but didn't like their process. First, they take around 10 days or more to approve/disapprove the test and then if they approve they pay in next 7 days. They rejected my first test and i am waiting for result on my 2nd test for more than a week now. I don't feel like continuing on Validately. Would love to know your opinion on Validately. 3. Lastly, it will be great if you can give me some tips on being a good tester for website and apps. Thank you all.",other

The chrome extension never starts when I click start recording so I have to use Firefox to launch the clunky desktop app. The Usertesting app has screen recording permissions but the upload size seems ridiculously small (40mb for a 20-minute test) and I'm scared my screen isn't recording. I dunno if the Mac desktop app has ridiculous compression or something else but can anyone else confirm their own usual upload sizes? I've emailed support but don't expect to hear back for a while.

I never had any technical issues with Usertesting before this incident. Once I qualify for a tester and I accept the job, I usually see a button with a 15 minute countdown called Start Recorder which I need to click to start. The last few days, every tester that I qualified for, this particular button is not functional when I click on it. I do my tester on my desktop but when I reach that button, I click on it and nothing happens. The first time I didn't know what to do and I informed Usertesting but they didn't get back to me and they didn't have the chat option available. I could not proceed and lost the chance to do the tester. Since then, in order to proceed, I have to right click on the button and click on Open link in new tab. It brings me to the tester but the layout is different as if I am accessing an older version. The completed tester did show up on my Completed Tests page but for the first time ever, when I clicked on Check for Missing Videos, there was something to upload. This normally does not happen. I don't understand what is going on. I hope they get back to me or fix the problem. Just wanted to see if anyone had experienced something similar.",recorder

Then I bought a new tablet, and I tried to download the app and install it on my tablet. I was presented with an introduction page that would not let me log in. It ONLY asked for my email address, and I put that in and then it brings me to a page that says ""Welcome to the Dynamics panel by Microsoft - Business Applications Group"" and attempts to get me to create a new account. If I enter my information, like first name, last name and email address, etc. it tells me my PayPal email is already taken. Of course, it is taken by my account. But since I can't log into my account and it's trying to create a new one it thinks I'm inputting someone else's PayPal email. I was able to continue to do tests on my phone app though. But last week I somehow got logged out of my phone app and now I get the same screen (no way to log in). So now I can't take tests on my phone or tablet (unless I create a new account for each one I suppose... I don't really want to create that many PayPal email addresses). I tried contacting UserTesting support, both on Facebook and through the website, but their initial response was just 1) I need to enter my email and password to log in (nope) or 2) something is wrong with my password (nope). It just never asks me to log in to my account. I am hoping the long response I'm waiting on for my second email to support is because they're looking into this as an app issue and not as user error. But I was kind of shocked to not see anyone else having an issue. I didn't know there was a reddit for this so maybe someone can help me out here. I am using a file that ends in 4.21.2694.apk and I assume that might be the version number. I'm using a Samsung Tab A and Samsung Galaxy Phone. I took a photo of the log in screen than I get here: https://postimg.cc/ZB8JHbPM The the next page after I put in my email that asks for information looks like this: https://postimg.cc/4n18cYHh That's where it is trying to set up an account rather than log me in. Maybe there is an older version of the app I could use? But then if I remember correctly they used to make me update before I could take tests, so I think really it just needs to be updated. I would really appreciate some help. I know I'm losing out on tests not being able to log in.",bug

I also did turn off the enhancements option this time around as well for the next time. I'm hoping that helps. So here I was again, ready to go through my next test. I'm about halfway through and since I'm talking out loud to myself, Alexa decides to chime in with ""I can't seem to find what you're looking for."" Embarrassing.

Long story short, to my amazement, after at least 15 questions i actually got the test and was getting ready to give my best UX review about printers, or so at least i thought.. The test just ended up being a 10 or so question survey about what email apps, if any, do you use on your phone for work. Took roughly 2 mins to complete. What happened about the printers? lol Weird.

451,Macbook Pro running very hot/fan blasting with Chrome super laggy and slow during tests,3,4,5/22/20 6:21,"Hey everyone, I have noticed that occasionally when I would run a test on my Macbook Pro I would get some tests that would almost immediately after opening the recorder cause my Google Chrome to be running extremely slow/laggy and within a few seconds my computer gets extremely hot and the fan starts blasting. This has significantly impacted my testing experience and I'm sure the customer's listening experience in regards to my recording. I am trying to figure out why this happens. It used to happen a few weeks ago and I found that disabling my Adblocker on Google Chrome made it stop for the most part. Today I have done several tests on my laptop again and noticed that each one is causing the same problem to happen. Chrome is unbearably slow/laggy and the fan is blasting like crazy. I have a brand new Macbook pro that has high-performance capabilities (and this does not happen to every test so I know it is more than capable of handling it), I have the most updated google chrome, adblocker, and protection/malware programs on my computer disabled, and my computer is running the newest firmware. Could this be that the simple websites which the tester is directing me to for their specific tests are causing this? For the most part they are just simple websites displaying pictures so I highly doubt that is the case. Has anyone had the same experience and/or know of a solution? Thank you!",other

There is literally nothing to view or click on. I've tried waiting until it loads completely, tried refreshing multiple times, even copying and pasting in another browser, and nothing. Every time it's blank white. I've also had 3 tests with the IPEVO camera where the screen recorder has totally frozen in the middle of the test. The weird thing about this is that it always freezes at a specific step depending on the test. (I know this because I have exited out of the recorder and opened it again to try to restart the test in case it was just a glitch). For example one time I was doing a longer test that had been reserved for me... I got to step 16 and had been recording for 20 minutes, when I clicked ""Next Task"" and it froze. It freezes so that you cannot even click ""previous"" or ""help"". The only thing I could do was exit completely and separately report a problem. My last frustration is that I have reported these problems every time with screenshots and proof and I have NEVER received a response from Usertesting and I have never been compensated for my time. I'm starting to get really angry. I have been a tester for 5 years and have a 5 star rating... this sort of thing has never happened before, and my requests for help were always answered. The last 10 or more requests I have sent it seems have been totally ignored, and I'm owed about $80 at least for all these technical problems that were not my fault, since Usertesting says that if there's a problem not on the tester's end, you will be compensated for your time.

I can't find it now, but basically it said that if the client doesn't say upfront that they'll pay more for you going overtime then you won't receive compensation for the extra time. The person linked to this article: https://testersupport.usertesting.com/hc/en-us/articles/360030660172-Why-haven-t-I-received-my-bonus-payment- I understand that from that article it sounds like you only get paid for overtime if the client says they will first. However, today I did receive a couple of extra payments for a couple of tests that went overtime from the past. Thankfully the support team is getting a bit better at responding to things than they used to be. I just wanted to let people know that if it does go overtime (not by just a couple of minutes of course, but like 25+ mins on a supposedly 15 minute test) then the client should have booked a 30 min live interview or preemptively said the bonus would be offered for the un-moderated tests if they want that much information and they should be paying more for your time, and so just report it to be compensated for your time. But obviously don't try to drag out a test with unhelpful talk to try to squeeze more money from their clients.

406,Similar test,6,4,5/30/20 14:52,"Hi, I'm relatively new to usertesting, so please be kind =) Appreciate all constructive advice. I recently did 2 tests that were very similar. The screeners were the same and I got accepted for both tests. The website was the same but the first task for the second test was not the same as the first task for the first test and so I kept on going, thinking that the second test would be different to the first and that they must have improved something on the test or the webpage between the first test and the second test, otherwise I shouldn't have gotten through. Turns out that the tasks done for both were the same but the order in which they asked the tasks to be performed were different. However when I look back at ""Completed Tests"", the task details for both were the same (and in the same order), even though when I did the second test, I swear the order of the tasks were different and the screen recording should prove that. In the second test, I also took a different route to perform some of the tasks and actually found a broken link in the webpage, which I did not find in the first test. The tests were done 4 hours apart and had completely different test numbers. I read now on this subreddit that I should have reported and quit the second test, but as I found the broken link and also as the task order for the second test was different to the first (which made me think the tests were different), I kept on going and the second test was submitted. So what should I do now? Should I be proactive and write to Support and ask them to invalidate my second test? I am ok to miss out on the $10 for the second test even though I did find the broken link. I'd rather not get a bad rating because of this. As I am new, I am currently on 4.3 with 5, 5 and 3. A bad rating will put me below 4, which I believe will limit my chances of getting other tests. Of course I will learn from learn from this experience but appreciate any constructive advice that you have. Thanks!",ratings

410,Tester requires face recording during regular Usertesting test,6,8,5/30/20 4:28,"Hey everyone so I have seen this question asked, although very rarely, during the screener for regular tests (NOT LIVE TESTS) ""Are you comfortable recording your face during this test?"". Today I had a test I passed the screener and one of the questions was the question I stated above, and I said yes. When I started the test it told me to go to [Turncameraon.com](https://Turncameraon.com). So during the recording I went to this website and on my Chrome browser it said ""This site canâ€™t be reached. **turncameraon.com** refused to connect."". During the test I also tried googling it and getting access to the website that way as well and had the same problem (I later tried on my phone and another web browser as well on my computer and they both had the same issue so I know the website was actually not working properly). I ended up reporting and ending the test because the website didn't work. My question here is when you typically use [turncameraon.com](https://turncameraon.com) during a test, will the test recorder even pick up the face recording? I thought that the Usertesting platform recorder is only recording the actual tab you have open that you start the test in. This is because every time I make a new tab or open a link in a new tab that is mentioned during a usertesting test, the recorder button on the top right corner disappears and seems like it does not function when you leave the page. If this is the case how would you be able to complete a test and at the same time show your face recording on another tab. It is a bit confusing and just I want to know if any of you have had experience actually doing this during a test. Thanks!",bad test

339,How do you submit a report to Usertesting when the test takes too long,0,5,6/13/20 4:15,"Hello everyone, so in this post I am referring to situations where you see that the test is long when you start it up (even though the customer never put anywhere in the screener or during the test that the test will last longer than usual), but you decide to continue up until the 15-20 minute mark and then report a problem with the test to Usertesting in order to get compensated the $10. The process is detailed on Usertesting's FAQ section at this URL: [https://testersupport.usertesting.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003867991-How-to-report-a-problem-while-recording](https://testersupport.usertesting.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003867991-How-to-report-a-problem-while-recording) (and I summarize this below) &#x200B; Basically my main question here is when you actually click ""Report a problem"" whether it be on the mobile app or desktop, which specific reason am I supposed to select next in terms of the options: ""Report a problem with the website"", ""Report a problem with the recorder"", or ""Other Problem"". In my opinion ""Other Problem"" is the most accurate one here that I would then report that the test took too long even after I hit the 15-20 minute mark, there were still more tasks to continue so I did not want to continue the test and that I would like to be compensated for my time. &#x200B; To sum it up here are the key points in the URL that I am addressing: &#x200B; ""From time to time you may encounter an issue during a test that prevents you from moving forward.Â Here are some reasons you may not want to proceed: * There are too many tasks to complete within the standard 15-20 minutes, and there was no screener allowing you to opt-in to spending more time on the test &#x200B; ***When you report a problem for a test with an issue that is outside of your control,*** we'll pay you in accordance with the following payment schedule. Keep in mind that we reserve the right to withhold payment or change the payment amount to fit the situation. In addition, the chart is based on the reasonable amount of time a participant would have spent prior to reporting the problem.Â We aren't able to pay you if you submit an incomplete video (where you couldn't complete the test) without reporting a problem. **Tests:**Â  Â **Computer/UserTesting App**Â  Less than 2 minutes:Â $0 2-4 minutes: $3 5-9 minutes: $5 10-14 minutes: $7 15 or more minutes: $10""",bad test

324,Client Wanted A Different Time Zone,4,2,6/17/20 6:15,"Last week I accepted a a live chat for this week. During the screener it mentioned that they would like me to select a time in the time zone of IST (India Standard Time). However when the time came to schedule it, the page clearly said what time I was picking was in Central time (my time zone). Then I got a notification on my dashboard that the test would be at 4 PM Central. 15 minutes before 4 PM Central a ""Join Test"" button would appear. Today I got a message about the test, and they were asking if I was sure that I could be there at 2 PM IST (which was the completely wrong time anyway). 2PM IST would have been about 3:30 in the morning here and I would have just done it if i had to (and if it was ok with UserTesting), which I told them. But I also wrote back to them that the User Testing dashboard gives me a ""join test"" button 15 mins prior to the time it's listing which was 4PM Central. I told them I couldn't see how I could even join a session without that. I was just thinking that doing a live interview with someone without going through the ""join test"" button from UserTesting would probably mean you wouldn't get paid, right? But then I remembered that I got an email that some clients would use other programs than Zoom for live chats in the future, and I went looking around for information on that. I believe you have to click on the ""join test"" button for those though. It doesn't matter now because after I messaged the client I also sent a support ticket into UserTesting and at some point it got cancelled, which I understand. I think it was probably the client who cancelled versus anything done by UserTesting because I didn't receive a response to my message to UT. The client likely didn't understand how that join test button and scheduling thing worked seeing as how they asked people to choose in IST not knowing that the calendar tells you (the tester) what time it is in your time zone. But I was just curious on thoughts about the whole situation, especially seeing as how I haven't heard anything official from UserTesting about it yet.

286,Conversion Crimes Update.,5,5,6/26/20 9:03,"First off, I want to add a disclaimer here. I have been working as a paid consultant for Conversion Crimes for a very short time now. This is the first post about them I have made since joining the team, but going forward, the fact that I am getting paid as a consultant could possibly color my opinion of the platform, but I'll do my best to not let any bias creep into my posts. I just wanted that out there. Quinn, the founder of CC, just sent out an email a little bit ago, in it she says "" *We are currently training one of YOU guys to be our first tester advocate. They will help us come up with arrangements that work for both parties. I want Conversion Crimes to be the best place for testers to work and itâ€™s a privilege and pleasure to do so. ""* That's me. I am helping to flesh out their moderation team and helping to make sure the new tester onboarding process is strict, but fair, and that it will help people grow their testing skills. I am also one of the liaisons between the testers and the CC team. If you use the ticketing system on the site, it might be me that answers. I am just a tester like the rest of you, so I have a decent understanding of the frustrations and issues a lot of us encounter and I am on your side. &#x200B; CC is a very small team, but very talented and they sincerely want to see people succeed at testing. Having a small but talented group of testers is also still the focus, instead of the massive group of testers Usertesting has. After the beta, when signups open up again, they will only be taking a limited amount of people and you'll need to pass the three short training tests to prove you are either already a good tester, or can take feedback well and grow into one before joining the pool of testers. &#x200B; Also, another reminder, CC is still in Beta and **still not accepting new testers.** &#x200B; **Most of the email Quinn sent out is for tester's eyes only, so if you received it, please do not share the details here!!** There are a couple of things I can share though... Quinn came up with a great way to give an incentive to clients to rate our tests. I think it will make both testers and clients very happy. No details for now, but I think people will really like it and it should lead to having more of your tests fairly rated and feedback given. She also talked about tester notifications coming soon. The bones of it are in place, it just needs some work to finish it off. Lastly she said "" I want customers to know that if you want the most valuable user testing feedback videos - you go to Conversion Crimes. Which means weâ€™re going to be getting more selective and more focused on quality. "" &#x200B; &#x200B; They have a ton of things in the pipeline and some big changes coming very soon, so watch out for posts here and emails from CC directly. &#x200B; Oh yeah, please don't DM here with questions.

I searched this subreddit to see if someone else had encountered the same issue and the solutions they used, but couldnâ€™t find anything (which I tend to credit more to redditâ€™s search engine leaving something to be desired - to put it euphemistically - than to the factual lack of previously solved similar problems), so I decided to post this, since I doubt UserTesting support is going to reach out anytime soon.

Not even an interesting topic, about office printers with the most boring and terribly laid out website, so it would've taken close to an hour to do because you couldn't find a damn thing, not to mention probably wouldn't have uploaded so I wouldn't have been paid anyway. Desktop tests seem to always be better, don't take an hour and the upload never fails. Do I even have to mention when they put text boxes on there when you're literally speaking to the customer?

That's $33.00 accumulative for a tests I never got to take. On another platform, where I test AI for smart home, the test, which paid $16.00 was so full of glitch I couldn't complete even one of the tasks; I left detailed info on what was occurring, and they not only said they were going to pay me for that info, but provided a link for the retake at $20.00. That's $36.00 for 20.00 mins of my time. I'm not saying this boastfully. I'm just saying it seems to pay to take a professional approach more often then not, with reliable testing platforms. I see a lot of posts that seem to indicate they are not getting a response, but since I got a timely responses several times this week, I can't help wondering if it's the frustrated tone of the reports.

This one was only the 2nd one I ever did on mobile, I did way more on PC) I just had a mobile Zoom live conversation that was supposed to last 30 minutes. Because I was trying a downloaded prototype app (while sharing my screen) and the app completely covered my screen, I didn't get to see the time on my phone and I didn't pay attention to the running time. I was in the middle of the 7th prototype task when all of sudden my recording was abruptly cut off by UT. I got the exact same message you get when you finish a regular mobile test. The one that says: ""Screen Broadcasting / Live broadcast to UserTesting has stopped due to: Test complete."" I was very confused, I was no longer in the Zoom call, so I tried clicking the ""Join interview"" button sent to my email again... I was sent to a page that said: >**Thank you for speaking with us (my Zoom name)!** > >You did great! Our team may reach out to you as a followup if needed I never got this page before (I was relieved, ngl). I instantly took a screenshot of this message and I noticed that it was exactly 15 minutes after the 30-minute time slot finished. My test wasn't canceled and it's under my pending payments.

I just felt kinda bad because I didn't finish all the tasks they had planned, even though I do realize they should have done a 60-minute one if it was gonna take longer than 30 minutes. And I suppose the clients (in theory) should know that the live test could be abruptly cut off if they overdo the time slot, since they're the ones creating live conversations. I was hoping they would message me something but I got nothing. Definitely am not gonna get a rating for this, which sucks, but anyway... What I want to ask is, is this a recent change? Because I've never had live conversations when it was cut off all of sudden, the client actually had to end the meeting whenever they wanted to. My 1st mobile live conversation and the last two I did on PC went 20-ish minutes longer than the scheduled time. Did UT put a time limit on live tests so that testers don't abuse and use more time than what was scheduled (30 minutes or 60 minutes)? Thank you!",live convo

I'm early 30's, male, married, work full time, dog, cat etc I'm at the computer all day so i see pretty much see every screener come in. Last week after getting my first test with usertesting passed, my screeners went crazy, i counted 104 screeners in total last week. I got one interview out of those screeners the rest i DQ'd on. I did pick up one mobile test a couple days ago, but it didn't have a screener so i guess i was just lucky. But since that last mobile test (got rated 5 stars, i have 4.5 avg now), the screeners dropped off dramatically, i understand the weekends are slow, but today i never got one screener at all after being so busy with them last week. I've had a similar experiences with TryMyUi and Validately. Before completing my first test with TryMyUi,i had lots of screeners, after my first test(4 stars) they just stopped. Same with validately, got a screener every hour with them until i done my first two tests (got them the same day), screeners went from every hour to maybe one a day, now i don't get any at all for maybe the last 1.5 - 2 weeks. I thought i must have bombed the screeners so i contacted them to ask and they said i had a really good rating and probably the tests just don't fit my demographics. But then how come i was getting a screener every hour prior? Userfeel, i did the qualifier and scored a 5/5 but my overall rating was 2.5, so i was never getting tests. I emailed them to ask about the 2.5 rating and they said it was a mistake and adjusted it to 5/5. Still now having a 5/5 overall rating i have never received a screener to date. userlytics, nothing ever. Intellzoon, nothing ever. Userbrain, nothing ever.

I took the test naturally, stating everything as I went, and consistently reminded how I had only used online shopping once or twice in the past so was not a regular. &#x200B; However, after completing, I was left with a one star review that states. ""She lied. She had not used the app before."" &#x200B; First, I am a male. Second, the screener asked if you had used the app before (which I had) and how many times (which I put down as once in the past year). I am furious. Why accept someone who has used the app only once in the past year if you're going to call them a liar and rate them 1 star if they're not a master? &#x200B; This means I have now had no offers since then (not a single one).

Then you have to spam ""retry"" to get it to actually try again. So I use 4G for most of my uploads. Reliable connection, 5mbps up. I go ahead and upload, and it goes really quick, no issues, before failing at a random point throughout. This never used to happen, and once it fails I can't even forego payment, I always get compensation when it doesn't upload but in the email it says "" If you continue to have upload issues in the future you may not be eligible to receive payment. "" which is effectively threatening a ban, so I cannot take mobile tests anymore because I am at extreme risk of getting banned through no fault of my own.

Not ""take screener"", it says ""view test"" and takes you to the test, though still stays all responses recorded. These usually hang around for an hour or so in the dashboard. Here is a [screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/f6K5L08) from today of three screeners i passed yet remain in the dashboard after i get the ""All responses recorded"" message.

I was then able to take the screener which had the exact same questions as one of the screeners i passed on the PC. So even after loading up UT on my phone, having to install the new version, re-opening the app, taking the screener with the same questions, i was able to get the test on the mobile, yet i still can't get a single test on the PC no matter how quick i click it. It's all just starting to seem a bit strange that after all this time (5 weeks since i started) that i can't get one test on the PC after passing so many screeners, yet i get them on the mobile fine.

When a customer finds 1Password difficult to use, weâ€™re not achieving that goal.

For that reason, we donâ€™t use tracking or analytics, and we donâ€™t profile our customers.

733,Some Generic Tips for Usability Testing,20,16,8/17/19 2:58,"I thought I'd offer a few tips for those people just starting out. These are just generic tips for usability testing in general and **not** for any specific site. Also, these tips aren't the **ONLY** way to do testing, it's just the way I do it. It's probably common sense to some people too. I have been doing usability testing for a few years now, but got into it pretty heavy about two years ago. I seem to be pretty good at it and I really enjoy doing it. Here is the header from my [usertesting.com](https://usertesting.com) ledger. [https://imgur.com/mz6y07p](https://imgur.com/mz6y07p) I have a 4.9 rating currently. It does go down once in a while and it's been perfect too, but I am always between 4.7 and 5.0. There are 25 completed tests per page and you can see I have 17 pages of completed tests. My last page is almost full, so I am just under 425 total tests done, although some of the moderated and special tests were never in my ledger at all, so I am actually close to 440 completed tests on that site alone... I test for all the other big sites too, so my total usability tests are somewhere around 700. I just offer this info to show that I do have some experience in testing and you can trust what I say to at least work for me. I'm sure there are people with more experience than me and I hope they will offer up some tips here too. 1. **Be honest!** I can't stress this enough. Don't try and say what you think they want to hear. Give honest feedback. if you don't like something, tell them. Don't try and take tests you really aren't qualified to take too. 2. **Be polite!** I always try to put myself in the mind set that I am talking to a good friend about this stuff. I also try and smile while I am doing it. Obviously they can't see you, but I think it comes across in your voice. These people listen to a lot of strangers talking and a monotone/grumpy ass voice can turn them off, even if the person is offering good feedback. 3. **Pay attention!** Read and re-read the instructions out loud. Make sure you understand perfectly what they are asking you. If you don't understand what they are asking, say so and then say ""This is what I \*think\* you mean"" and give feedback on what you think they are asking. Take your time. Never try and speed through the test. The test should be the ONLY thing you are doing too. I once talked to somebody who was upset they received a bad rating on a test, but it was warranted because they were **EATING** while taking the test, lol. 4. **Environment!** Create a space to test in and make it comfortable. Being comfortable also comes across in your voice, more than you would think. Find someplace where you won't be bothered or interrupted in your test. Clients will often give you a low rating if there is a lot of distractions or extra noises in your test audio. Which leads me to my next topic... 5. **Equipment!** When I first started out I was using the internal mic on a laptop. It was ""ok"" most of the time, but I had one client who couldn't understand me at all. It was the only time I ever received a bad rating and [Usertesting.com](https://Usertesting.com) agreed with them. They made me prove the issue was fixed before they let me do any more tests. I bought a mid-range Razer headset and never had issues with sound again. The quality of your audio and video can make or break you. You don't have to spend a ton, but get something half way decent. There is a site who asks you NOT to use a headset though... Userlytics asks that you do not for desktop tests. They said it can somehow interfere, but I have always used a headset with them and have had no issues with sound. YMMV &#x200B; So hopefully these are some helpful hints. I want to reiterate that these tips aren't rules. They are just things that have worked for me and I seem to be pretty successful at usability testing. Each of the sites have their own quirks and rules to follow, so make sure you understand the difference in each place. You also need to find your ""style"" and what works for you the best, for example, I always introduce myself very quickly at the beginning of the test Like *""Hey there, this is Rikostan for* [*Validately.com*](https://Validately.com)*""* only I use my real name. I know a lot of people wouldn't want to use their real name in the test, but it doesn't bother me at all and I feel like it starts off the test on the right foot. &#x200B; Anybody else have some general tips to add? It would be awesome to turn this into a thread for newbies to help them learn how to offer the best feedback possible and get up to speed quickly. &#x200B; &#x200B; {EDIT} I forgot I wanted to also put up a great resource for testers. The /r/beermoney sub has a discord server. [https://discord.gg/bEJq8TX](https://discord.gg/bEJq8TX) There is a channel called ""Tasks"" there that has a ton of great info about Usability testing and other forms of online jobs.

So qualification seems not always been tested or looked at compared to the actual test, also evidently from some pics here (likes ones that did not do their qualification vetting and says ""select this to move on""). So the question is, do you know if the customers care what you select or do they only view your video?

It's not showing in my completed tests either. No email from them saying I've been compensated for a failed upload, nothing at all. I'm really confused. I've also got netlimiter installed, so I can see if chrome is uploading. Nothing is uploading so no one has received any form of video. It makes absolutely zero sense. Usually if I get compensated for internet failure or something I get an email from UT support (bot) telling me. EDIT: I just checked the FAQ's and this explains it, was updated 2 days ago: [https://testersupport.usertesting.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003700971-Do-I-get-paid-when-the-screen-recorder-crashes-](https://testersupport.usertesting.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003700971-Do-I-get-paid-when-the-screen-recorder-crashes-)",payment

95,IPEVO Camera App issue. Uploading test takes hours,3,2,8/4/20 2:32,"I just found this sub reddit today after searching about the Android issue with the app ""Something went wrong try again later"". Since it has a great community response i thought I would throw another question out there and see if anyone else is having or had this issue in the past. So every time I get a test which requires the IPEVO camera to record my phone regardless of how long the test record for 10 minutes or even 30 minutes it seems the test will always never upload in time before the test is released to another usertester. About 2-3hours. *You get an email warning you about 1.5hours before the test is released.* I never have issues uploaded from my Phone or even using the Browser app when taking a normal test. 45 minute test upload less than 10 minutes, but with the program that uses the IPEVO camera it takes hours to upload a simple 15 minute file. Here's what happens, When I finish the test and start to upload it using the usertesting app that I recorded it on. The first 50% of the upload goes quickly then every percent afterwards happens every 5-10 minutes which causes the test to timeout and get released to another user tester. Quite annoying when you spend quality time giving feedback only to not have it published to the customer. I sometimes have luck after I finish taking my IPEVO test allow it to upload for a minute and cancel the upload. Find the test on my computer and use the Usertesting program that helps you upload test that fails when uploading. This seems to go much quicker sometimes than using the IPEVO usertesting upload process. This makes me think that maybe the program is using an old connected server or something that is congested. Like I said before I never have this issue when uploading a test from my phone or when I take a normal browser test. It's only the IPEVO camera test which upload very slowly. This is my connection speed &#x200B; [Current connection speed](https://preview.redd.it/muw5u323mte51.png?width=350&format=png&auto=webp&s=e67299d4df0d9a7986c3dfe5dfe6109493f64a85) Does anyone else have this issue, and if so how have you corrected it?

79,Thoughts and Opinions on Userbrain,7,16,8/7/20 19:45,"I'm just trying out different sites similar to usertesting and basically seeing which ones are consistent and nice to do. So currently a consistent one for me is userbrain. After a qualification test, and passing it, it did take a couple of weeks before I actually received any tests, although that may have partially been on my part due to not fully understanding how userbrain worked. So I only do desktop tests since I dont have an iphone with ios 13 meaning that I limit myself to pc only. So how userbrain works on pc is that you download the chrome extension onto chrome and that acts as your notification with a number bubble to indicate you have tests. I may have received some tests before but never noticed this notification so ye. I only noticed it yesterday. So basically my experience with userbrain started yesterday. So I have done 4 tests not including the qualification test. Userbrain pays $3 per test which compared to usertesting is far less and may seem not worth it. But when you add in the fact that each test that you receive is a test that you can do, meaning no needto go through screeners or questions, it means its a guaranteed $3 as long as you do the test and at a standard quality. In terms of quantity, it appears to be in bursts? Like if I get a test now then usually another pops up soon after and then the rest of the time is dead. Of course this is with 2 days worth of experience so it's short sighted. I want to ask on the experience of others. Sorry for this long chunk of text.",other

So i stopped the sharing and quit the thing. Then i saw this thing that i didn't need to do a screener for yet right before clicking on accept, it disappeared. 3rd time, qualified for a phone test. I used someone else's iPhone. They ask me to download a thing before doing the test. I did it like 4 times yet it was nowhere to be found. I m an Android user so don't really know much about iPhone but i went and asked my brother who has one and he could not figure it himself resulting in me cancelling the job again. So 0$ today instead of 30$...super pissed. Am i the only one to whom this happened? This seems to be a great website so everything that happened today is super frustrating!",no test

If you go extremely fast while explaining why some of these steps cannot be completed on a timely manner it will still take you a minimum of 30 minutes. i have reported 3 of them already. there's no indication that it's going to be long or have a bonus, besides the high number of tasks. some of them include watching demo videos of the platform, reading whitepapers, browsing through case studies and plenty more",bad test
705,Poorly designed qualifiers,10,9,9/16/19 1:23,"I'll often log on and take qualifiers for tests only to be met with a list that says something along the lines of ""Which of these items are you looking to purchase in the next 3 months?"". I don't mind them when they have check-boxes that allow me to select multiple answers because, more often than not, more than 1 of the options apply to me. What I have a problem with is the qualifiers that have bubbles instead of check-boxes that only allow you to select one answer out of the list. This means that I miss out on doing a fair amount test just because I had to make a choice between telling them I wanted to buy a cell phone instead of a new TV even though I'm in the market for a new phone AND a new TV. Anyone else share my frustration? Why doesn't UT just ditch the bubbles and allow for multiple selections on their qualifiers?",screeners
703,Unusual usertesting of a new podcast for the bedroom,3,8,9/18/19 11:51,"I don't know if this is appropriate to post here, but thought we'd give it a try.

I have no other ratings but the initial one (4 stars) visible, and the FAQ says that some testers choose to give private ratings that aren't visible to me. I have about 30 tests completed total. Now, I'm getting no screeners at all, so I see no way to dig myself out of the ratings hole, and since I don't know why I got the rating I did that lowered my overall rating, I can't contact support and ask, can I? Am I just screwed now? &#x200B; Update: While I was waiting for my test to be reviewed, another test got rated highly and brought me back up a bit.

I started usertesting again after a few years off and it's been going great. However, when I was testing before, they didn't yet have the ability to use the app and screen capture from your phone. I've noticed that some tests say to open up the app on your phone and other screeners are within the browser, but say that it's for iphone or ipad. Are these one's that are not on the mobile app supposed to be done with the document cam the way that you used to do mobile reviews?

Today I just qualified for a test about a healthcare site that had 135 questions. I quit and reported the test for being too long, normally I would've continued the test but with everything being up in the air about if extra money would be ""awarded"" to the users I didn't want to risk another 45 minutes for nothing. I feel like I've noticed a lot of people mentioning that they've seen an uptick in long tests, or am I just imagining things? I still will get my normal 10-15 minute tests but I've never had any other than 1 that went for 23 minutes a month or two ago that are this long.",bad test
694,Conversion Crimes Update.,9,47,9/25/19 22:59,"There is a video under Updates if you already have an account, but here is a summary for those people who didn't get in during the open registrations. [https://conversioncrimes.com](https://conversioncrimes.com) &#x200B; First off, they are shooting for a November go-live. They mentioned that they are a very small team of only 8 people and they have another company that is actually their main focus right now, so please be patient. Next they talked about opening up registrations because they need more testers with some specific skills and also because once you take a test for a domain, you can't take the test again if it's been tweaked. They said that they are **not** going to implement any type of screener system at all, but if there are special requirements listed, they expect us to follow those and only take tests we are qualified to take. If you take tests you are not qualified to take and the client complains, there will be consequences. If you do it often, you could lose your account or at the very least get a low rating or not get paid for the test at all. They also talked about having more in-depth and higher paying tests in the future. Something that takes a lot more effort, but also pays more. Then they talked about opening up other avenues for us to earn, like helping them moderate tests. That would entail listening/watching to tests other testers have completed and looking at 5 star tests to see if they warrant a bonus, or tests rated less than two stars, you'd see if it warranted that rating. Obviously this would only be for people who had an aptitude for it and proved the ability to do this task. They also said we could possibly become test writers. When they let us test the other side of it a couple of months ago, they were surprised by how good some of our tests were. So there are some avenues for making money other than just testing.",other company

I've never had this happen before, but Usertesting sent me an email saying they had to review one of my tests because the customer asked to have me replaced. They said my test was incomplete. They said when I got to the image for task three I moved to task four without viewing it. Task four switched to a different image so I never saw task 3. I don't remember anything like that happening. I do remember doing a test around the date they mention where when I tried to move on to the next task it told me there would be a new image and there wasn't. I explained my confusion in the video and tried to complete it as best I could. I guess I should have reported a problem instead, never had to do that so didn't think about doing that. Man, the tone of the email made me feel shame. I'm wondering if it's the same test I had in issue mostly out of curiosity.

They also stated while going through the mic checks and such that userfeel also rates your test as well as the client so i'm wondering if userfeel just haven't got around to approving/rejecting them yet? I doubt the client is still waiting to receive the tests after this long. Has anyone had any experience with this and their tests still pending after a while?,other company

Please be prepared to discuss your thoughts and observations in real time."" and also ""Join the interview from our reminder email on your mobile device"" I never got any reminder because i never passed any screener for a live interview.

687,"Single test, 193 tasks. New record?",12,10,9/28/19 6:28,"Courtesy of Capital One. Starting with one of the obnoxious screener types wanting to know: * my gender * my role in household financial decision making * whether or not I'd participated in a focus group or one-on-one interview in the past six months * whether or not I worked in certain disqualifying industries (ie. marketing) * whether or not I have a credit card * who it's from * how much I charge to it every month * whether or not I pay it off in full every month * whether or not I'm comfortable with my current balance * what my credit score is From there, I'm offered the test where it is explained to me that they are looking for feedback on e-mails that they send to customers. ""10 e-mails with 20 questions on each, some of which will require you to explain your answer."" I guess in all fairness they did warn that it would take 45-60 minutes for the test. What it didn't do was offer a bonus for completion of the over-long tedium, and my experience has been that whatever estimate you're given for how long someone thinks it might take for you to do a 'survey' like that, triple it and that's about the minimum it's really going to take. (Unless you're rushing, not reading questions properly, and generally not doing a good job.) I stopped to consider whether I wanted to do the test and then follow up with UT for increased payment, but then I realized that for that kind of test, it could go the exact opposite way. Imagine I only get through half the test when I run out of time and end up with a 1- or 2-star rating for not completing it. As a matter of principle, I don't let people take advantage of me, and I don't put myself in a position where I end up worse off for doing what is asked of me within the restrictions imposed by someone else. I feel as though they're putting more attention into how to write a good e-mail than they did in their security systems. For 193 tasks on a 1 hour time limit and no promise of a bonus, about all I'd be willing to do for them is let them kiss my ass. (In general, I don't name names when discussing a test, but this one felt borderline abusive and I think a certain amount of shame attached to the company is warranted.)",bad test
