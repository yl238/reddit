I've just found the time to start applying for the rest of the other sites now, and I was wondering if there is anything that anyone would be willing to tell a stranger, that they should know. Are there any tips that I should know when doing these sites? And is there anything that should I expect? I'd greatly appreciate any info that anyone is willing to give me.

How much should I expect to make from User Testing in a month?,5,18,2019-12-11 16:46:00,"How much should I expect to make from User Testing in a month? I am relatively new to online testing and have a couple of questions from more experienced members. 1. How much should I expect to make from User Testing in a month? I have just recently started doing on the User Testing website, I am able to do 1 test in a day on an average after going through 10 -15 screeners. I wanted to know that is it the same for most of the testers. I am 3 weeks old in testing and I certainly made enough money to fund my beer for 3 months :P 2. Also, I have tried Validately, but didn't like their process. First, they take around 10 days or more to approve/disapprove the test and then if they approve they pay in next 7 days. They rejected my first test and i am waiting for result on my 2nd test for more than a week now. I don't feel like continuing on Validately. Would love to know your opinion on Validately. 3. Lastly, it will be great if you can give me some tips on being a good tester for website and apps. Thank you all.",other

I sent an email to report the test as i felt it took way too long without being notified of extra time or being offered an additional payment. I really did feel i completed the test at very reasonable speed and in no way was i trying to be flaky by reporting it. Usertesting got back to me today, upon reviewing the test they were very nice and thanked me for letting them know and paid me additional compensation to reflect the extra time it took($10). I kind of feel bad if UT had to front the cost and not the client(Not sure who had to pay), but at the end of the day i think it was the right thing to report it.",bad test

Bonuses still on for going overtime in tests,6,5,2020-05-28 01:45:00,"Bonuses still on for going overtime in tests I was browsing here last week and saw a comment. I can't find it now, but basically it said that if the client doesn't say upfront that they'll pay more for you going overtime then you won't receive compensation for the extra time. The person linked to this article: https://testersupport.usertesting.com/hc/en-us/articles/360030660172-Why-haven-t-I-received-my-bonus-payment- I understand that from that article it sounds like you only get paid for overtime if the client says they will first. However, today I did receive a couple of extra payments for a couple of tests that went overtime from the past. Thankfully the support team is getting a bit better at responding to things than they used to be. I just wanted to let people know that if it does go overtime (not by just a couple of minutes of course, but like 25+ mins on a supposedly 15 minute test) then the client should have booked a 30 min live interview or preemptively said the bonus would be offered for the un-moderated tests if they want that much information and they should be paying more for your time, and so just report it to be compensated for your time. But obviously don't try to drag out a test with unhelpful talk to try to squeeze more money from their clients.

What broken tests can do for you....,8,7,2020-07-14 01:18:00,"What broken tests can do for you.... I know broken tests can be frustrating. But I just want to encourage everyone that they are not really a bad thing to encounter. Last week we had numerous tests with poor instructions (not even broke) and I qualified for them (hearing loss) but the instructions were so bad that I couldn't complete them...I reported every one of them with details and nice tone- I was paid $10.00 for 2 of them, $5.00 for 2x of them, and $3.00 for another in keeping with how far I was into the test, within the week. That's $33.00 accumulative for a tests I never got to take. On another platform, where I test AI for smart home, the test, which paid $16.00 was so full of glitch I couldn't complete even one of the tasks; I left detailed info on what was occurring, and they not only said they were going to pay me for that info, but provided a link for the retake at $20.00. That's $36.00 for 20.00 mins of my time. I'm not saying this boastfully. I'm just saying it seems to pay to take a professional approach more often then not, with reliable testing platforms. I see a lot of posts that seem to indicate they are not getting a response, but since I got a timely responses several times this week, I can't help wondering if it's the frustrated tone of the reports. Just some food for thought, and happy testing!",bad test

IPEVO Camera App issue. Uploading test takes hours,3,2,2020-08-04 02:32:00,"IPEVO Camera App issue. Uploading test takes hours I just found this sub reddit today after searching about the Android issue with the app ""Something went wrong try again later"". Since it has a great community response i thought I would throw another question out there and see if anyone else is having or had this issue in the past. So every time I get a test which requires the IPEVO camera to record my phone regardless of how long the test record for 10 minutes or even 30 minutes it seems the test will always never upload in time before the test is released to another usertester. About 2-3hours. *You get an email warning you about 1.5hours before the test is released.* I never have issues uploaded from my Phone or even using the Browser app when taking a normal test. 45 minute test upload less than 10 minutes, but with the program that uses the IPEVO camera it takes hours to upload a simple 15 minute file. Here's what happens, When I finish the test and start to upload it using the usertesting app that I recorded it on. The first 50% of the upload goes quickly then every percent afterwards happens every 5-10 minutes which causes the test to timeout and get released to another user tester. Quite annoying when you spend quality time giving feedback only to not have it published to the customer. I sometimes have luck after I finish taking my IPEVO test allow it to upload for a minute and cancel the upload. Find the test on my computer and use the Usertesting program that helps you upload test that fails when uploading. This seems to go much quicker sometimes than using the IPEVO usertesting upload process. This makes me think that maybe the program is using an old connected server or something that is congested. Like I said before I never have this issue when uploading a test from my phone or when I take a normal browser test. It's only the IPEVO camera test which upload very slowly. This is my connection speed &#x200B; [Current connection speed](https://preview.redd.it/muw5u323mte51.png?width=350&format=png&auto=webp&s=e67299d4df0d9a7986c3dfe5dfe6109493f64a85) Does anyone else have this issue, and if so how have you corrected it? I have tried to contact User testing support about the issue and it seems they don't know. &#x200B; Thanks again",recorder
Reporting a test,4,6,2020-08-07 04:24:00,"Reporting a test I just had a test that I had to quit and report after 20 minutes . It was not my fault but I would like to be paid for my time and Usertesting normally reimburses me for instances like these. For this one, I am not seeing it in my list of Requests nor did I receive a confirmation email. I find that odd because the others did show up in my list of Requests and I seem to recall getting a confirmation email also (but not 100% certain). Just wanted to know if anyone else is having the same experience. They have not been answering my emails lately and this is quite frustrating as I have more issues that need to be addressed.

Completed and recorded it, it was uploaded. However, after the upload ended and the dashboard page loaded, it displayed a message that the test was still in progress, therefore I wouldnâ€™t be receiving any more tests until that one was complete. This situation persists until today (26th). I did the protocol of checking for non uploaded tests multiple times and nothing was found. I sent an e-mail to UserTesting support and am yet to receive any answer. When I open the mobile app, the same message shows up but it also wonâ€™t let me report the issue. I searched this subreddit to see if someone else had encountered the same issue and the solutions they used, but couldnâ€™t find anything (which I tend to credit more to redditâ€™s search engine leaving something to be desired - to put it euphemistically - than to the factual lack of previously solved similar problems), so I decided to post this, since I doubt UserTesting support is going to reach out anytime soon. If anyone has encountered themselves in a situation quite like mine, could you please share how you dealt with it? Iâ€™d preferably be able to fully complete and keep the money from this particular faulty test, but if this is not an option, I guess being able to receive new tests is a more pressing matter.

Did UT change something regarding Zoom live conversations and their scheduled time limit?,0,2,2020-07-21 17:27:00,"Did UT change something regarding Zoom live conversations and their scheduled time limit? (Some context: I don't have much experience with live conversations because I rarely do them due to anxiety, but I'm working on improving that every time I get the chance. This one was only the 2nd one I ever did on mobile, I did way more on PC) I just had a mobile Zoom live conversation that was supposed to last 30 minutes. Because I was trying a downloaded prototype app (while sharing my screen) and the app completely covered my screen, I didn't get to see the time on my phone and I didn't pay attention to the running time. I was in the middle of the 7th prototype task when all of sudden my recording was abruptly cut off by UT. I got the exact same message you get when you finish a regular mobile test. The one that says: ""Screen Broadcasting / Live broadcast to UserTesting has stopped due to: Test complete."" I was very confused, I was no longer in the Zoom call, so I tried clicking the ""Join interview"" button sent to my email again... I was sent to a page that said: >**Thank you for speaking with us (my Zoom name)!** > >You did great! Our team may reach out to you as a followup if needed I never got this page before (I was relieved, ngl). I instantly took a screenshot of this message and I noticed that it was exactly 15 minutes after the 30-minute time slot finished. My test wasn't canceled and it's under my pending payments. But I felt so bad because the moderator was so nice and I was literally speaking doing a task when UT cut me off and ended it. I just felt kinda bad because I didn't finish all the tasks they had planned, even though I do realize they should have done a 60-minute one if it was gonna take longer than 30 minutes. And I suppose the clients (in theory) should know that the live test could be abruptly cut off if they overdo the time slot, since they're the ones creating live conversations. I was hoping they would message me something but I got nothing. Definitely am not gonna get a rating for this, which sucks, but anyway... What I want to ask is, is this a recent change? Because I've never had live conversations when it was cut off all of sudden, the client actually had to end the meeting whenever they wanted to. My 1st mobile live conversation and the last two I did on PC went 20-ish minutes longer than the scheduled time. Did UT put a time limit on live tests so that testers don't abuse and use more time than what was scheduled (30 minutes or 60 minutes)? Thank you!",live convo
