Fake 2 Star Reviews,7,3,2019-11-20 03:34:00,"Fake 2 Star Reviews Has anyone else been getting a lot of fake 2 star reviews lately?

This has been happening to me a lot lately and it used to only happen like once or twice a year. I'm guessing [usertesting.com](https://usertesting.com) makes it clear that if a test is 2 stars or less its free. &#x200B; My 2 star tests are always overturned, but it takes a week for usertesting to overturn them, meaning I have to spend that week with a lower overall rating than I deserve, and I end up missing tests.",ratings

I'm a little bit confused about if the comments were directed at me or if it was just a generic comment that's being given to the masses of people who recently signed up for usertesting. The first half of the message was about maintaining a running dialogue, reading the tasks out loud, etc. (which I'm pretty sure I did). I got 4/5 stars and this was part of the message received: ""For future tests, if you are unable to provide valuable feedback, cannot complete multiple tasks as instructed and/or if you find the customerâ€™s task instructions to be confusing, please do not click ""Stop Recording"" to submit an incomplete test to the customer. The customer will ask for a refund and will most likely give you a low rating. Instead, click the Help (?) button or tap Menu on the recorder to quit or report a problem. Someone from our staff will follow up with you. Before you take your next test, please review the following article: ""How to Report a Problem While Recording"" "" I didn't end the test early. The only issue I had was that in the second last task, I summarized all of my thoughts, suggestions, and thanked them for allowing me to test their app. Then I reached the last step, which asked me to do what I had just done so I ended my recording.",ratings

What broken tests can do for you....,8,7,2020-07-14 01:18:00,"What broken tests can do for you.... I know broken tests can be frustrating.

Last week we had numerous tests with poor instructions (not even broke) and I qualified for them (hearing loss) but the instructions were so bad that I couldn't complete them...I reported every one of them with details and nice tone- I was paid $10.00 for 2 of them, $5.00 for 2x of them, and $3.00 for another in keeping with how far I was into the test, within the week. That's $33.00 accumulative for a tests I never got to take. On another platform, where I test AI for smart home, the test, which paid $16.00 was so full of glitch I couldn't complete even one of the tasks; I left detailed info on what was occurring, and they not only said they were going to pay me for that info, but provided a link for the retake at $20.00. That's $36.00 for 20.00 mins of my time. I'm not saying this boastfully. I'm just saying it seems to pay to take a professional approach more often then not, with reliable testing platforms. I see a lot of posts that seem to indicate they are not getting a response, but since I got a timely responses several times this week, I can't help wondering if it's the frustrated tone of the reports.

Did UT change something regarding Zoom live conversations and their scheduled time limit?,0,2,2020-07-21 17:27:00,"Did UT change something regarding Zoom live conversations and their scheduled time limit? (Some context: I don't have much experience with live conversations because I rarely do them due to anxiety, but I'm working on improving that every time I get the chance. This one was only the 2nd one I ever did on mobile, I did way more on PC) I just had a mobile Zoom live conversation that was supposed to last 30 minutes. Because I was trying a downloaded prototype app (while sharing my screen) and the app completely covered my screen, I didn't get to see the time on my phone and I didn't pay attention to the running time. I was in the middle of the 7th prototype task when all of sudden my recording was abruptly cut off by UT. I got the exact same message you get when you finish a regular mobile test. The one that says: ""Screen Broadcasting / Live broadcast to UserTesting has stopped due to: Test complete."" I was very confused, I was no longer in the Zoom call, so I tried clicking the ""Join interview"" button sent to my email again... I was sent to a page that said: >**Thank you for speaking with us (my Zoom name)!** > >You did great! Our team may reach out to you as a followup if needed I never got this page before (I was relieved, ngl). I instantly took a screenshot of this message and I noticed that it was exactly 15 minutes after the 30-minute time slot finished. My test wasn't canceled and it's under my pending payments. But I felt so bad because the moderator was so nice and I was literally speaking doing a task when UT cut me off and ended it. I just felt kinda bad because I didn't finish all the tasks they had planned, even though I do realize they should have done a 60-minute one if it was gonna take longer than 30 minutes. And I suppose the clients (in theory) should know that the live test could be abruptly cut off if they overdo the time slot, since they're the ones creating live conversations. I was hoping they would message me something but I got nothing. Definitely am not gonna get a rating for this, which sucks, but anyway... What I want to ask is, is this a recent change? Because I've never had live conversations when it was cut off all of sudden, the client actually had to end the meeting whenever they wanted to. My 1st mobile live conversation and the last two I did on PC went 20-ish minutes longer than the scheduled time. Did UT put a time limit on live tests so that testers don't abuse and use more time than what was scheduled (30 minutes or 60 minutes)? Thank you!",live convo

I have made sure my browser and speaker sound settings are working as usual. I have had it where I am on the Usertesting page and it wont play a sound as I see new screeners pop up. I have had it where I am on Chrome but not directly on the Usertesting page (and I see new tests pop up on the top portion of the tab indicating a new test is there and when I go to the page I see new tests) but again no sound is played. I have also had it where I minimize Chrome and still no sound when screeners are coming up. What gives? Is there a new setting or something I am not aware of?

""She lied. She had not used the app before."" &#x200B; First, I am a male. Second, the screener asked if you had used the app before (which I had) and how many times (which I put down as once in the past year). I am furious. Why accept someone who has used the app only once in the past year if you're going to call them a liar and rate them 1 star if they're not a master? &#x200B; This means I have now had no offers since then (not a single one).

Bonuses still on for going overtime in tests,6,5,2020-05-28 01:45:00,"Bonuses still on for going overtime in tests I was browsing here last week and saw a comment.

The person linked to this article: https://testersupport.usertesting.com/hc/en-us/articles/360030660172-Why-haven-t-I-received-my-bonus-payment- I understand that from that article it sounds like you only get paid for overtime if the client says they will first. However, today I did receive a couple of extra payments for a couple of tests that went overtime from the past. Thankfully the support team is getting a bit better at responding to things than they used to be. I just wanted to let people know that if it does go overtime (not by just a couple of minutes of course, but like 25+ mins on a supposedly 15 minute test) then the client should have booked a 30 min live interview or preemptively said the bonus would be offered for the un-moderated tests if they want that much information and they should be paying more for your time, and so just report it to be compensated for your time.
