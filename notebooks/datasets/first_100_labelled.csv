Got $10 pending when I quit a test with no email??,2,11,8/21/20 5:07,"So I was doing a HSBC test, of the mobile app. Halfway through it, it was asking stuff which I wasn't able to do regarding international transfers (the app was broken) so I got frustrated and was about to quit out. However, my internet died just as I was about to quit so I forced closed chrome and everything. 5 minutes later, my internet comes back online and I go straight to Usertesting. The test has finished, and I'm back on the main screen with screeners waiting. To save confusion, it was a desktop test, where I was doing the tasks on my phone. Weird I know but I hope that makes sense. However, I checked my payment pending and it went up by $10, despite the fact I never uploaded the test. Wtf??? It's not showing in my completed tests either. No email from them saying I've been compensated for a failed upload, nothing at all. I'm really confused. I've also got netlimiter installed, so I can see if chrome is uploading. Nothing is uploading so no one has received any form of video. It makes absolutely zero sense.

Thoughts and Opinions on Userbrain,7,16,8/7/20 19:45,"I'm just trying out different sites similar to usertesting and basically seeing which ones are consistent and nice to do. So currently a consistent one for me is userbrain. After a qualification test, and passing it, it did take a couple of weeks before I actually received any tests, although that may have partially been on my part due to not fully understanding how userbrain worked. So I only do desktop tests since I dont have an iphone with ios 13 meaning that I limit myself to pc only. So how userbrain works on pc is that you download the chrome extension onto chrome and that acts as your notification with a number bubble to indicate you have tests. I may have received some tests before but never noticed this notification so ye. I only noticed it yesterday. So basically my experience with userbrain started yesterday. So I have done 4 tests not including the qualification test. Userbrain pays $3 per test which compared to usertesting is far less and may seem not worth it. But when you add in the fact that each test that you receive is a test that you can do, meaning no needto go through screeners or questions, it means its a guaranteed $3 as long as you do the test and at a standard quality. In terms of quantity, it appears to be in bursts? Like if I get a test now then usually another pops up soon after and then the rest of the time is dead. Of course this is with 2 days worth of experience so it's short sighted. I want to ask on the experience of others.

First Week Review F27 Canada,8,4,8/7/20 13:41,I thought I would post my review of using UserTesting for a week. I signed up last Thursday and did the demo. I was accepted within 24 hours . The next day I did my first test and I received my feedback a few hours later. I earned $140 USD in my 7 days. I was able to do two 30 minute live conversations and one 60 minute conversation. Which helped out a lot. I did have two issues a test didnâ€™t upload. And a test asked for too much information so I exited. Iâ€™m waiting to hear back from support. (I did not include the $20 in my total). Overall Iâ€™m very impressed with the site. The past few days I was out so I havenâ€™t been on the site since Tuesday. I havenâ€™t had much luck with the mobile apps. But on the computer site I was able to pass many of the screeners which was great.

IPEVO Camera App issue. Uploading test takes hours,3,2,8/4/20 2:32,"I just found this sub reddit today after searching about the Android issue with the app ""Something went wrong try again later"". Since it has a great community response i thought I would throw another question out there and see if anyone else is having or had this issue in the past. So every time I get a test which requires the IPEVO camera to record my phone regardless of how long the test record for 10 minutes or even 30 minutes it seems the test will always never upload in time before the test is released to another usertester. About 2-3hours. *You get an email warning you about 1.5hours before the test is released.* I never have issues uploaded from my Phone or even using the Browser app when taking a normal test. 45 minute test upload less than 10 minutes, but with the program that uses the IPEVO camera it takes hours to upload a simple 15 minute file. Here's what happens, When I finish the test and start to upload it using the usertesting app that I recorded it on. The first 50% of the upload goes quickly then every percent afterwards happens every 5-10 minutes which causes the test to timeout and get released to another user tester. Quite annoying when you spend quality time giving feedback only to not have it published to the customer. I sometimes have luck after I finish taking my IPEVO test allow it to upload for a minute and cancel the upload. Find the test on my computer and use the Usertesting program that helps you upload test that fails when uploading. This seems to go much quicker sometimes than using the IPEVO usertesting upload process. This makes me think that maybe the program is using an old connected server or something that is congested. Like I said before I never have this issue when uploading a test from my phone or when I take a normal browser test. It's only the IPEVO camera test which upload very slowly.
