Tests not showing on iPhone app,1,3,2/10/20 21:23,"Iâ€™ve been having this issue lately where my dashboard shows that thereâ€™s an iPhone test available but when I open the app on my iPhone thereâ€™s nothing there.

Tips from a researcher,34,16,2/8/20 6:00,"Hi testers! I found this subreddit today after I was looking into why all my participants were using the old desktop version of the UT recorder. Question answered! I'm a User Experience Researcher and I've been using usertesting for work for the last 3 years (mods I'm happy to provide verification if necessary). I just wanted to reach out to the community and say hi! As someone who has watched hundreds of your videos, first off, thank you for taking the time out of your life to do this! Feedback from testers like you all have been invaluable in making big decisions in the companies I've worked for. Your recordings and conversations do make a difference. Big tips from me: The most important thing I'm looking for is **honesty**. In shareouts, I have to tell my colleagues that the usertesting panel is too positive and to take ratings with a grain of salt. Be brutal - if something doesn't make sense to you, you making a point of calling it out can help fix it. If we ask you ""how likely would you be to consider xyz"" or ""how easy or difficult was that task"", rate it with your gut reaction. I'm cheering you guys on to tear stuff apart, because getting validation from testers helps move the needle for change. It also means when you like something, it makes that positive feedback even more compelling. Don't **be afraid to give up**, but **don't give up too easily**. This boils down to trying to imagine yourself completing something in the real world. Before confirming something, you'd probably check and see if you were doing the right thing. You'd also probably not spend 20 minutes trying to figure out something that's inconsequential. You can say ""this is the point where I'd probably give up on this"", and that's ok. The **more you talk, the more I get**. Like in some other threads I've seen on the sub, even if you don't know what to say in the moment, some ""umms"" might get you back to a place where you can think of something to add. Feel free to go ""on a tangent"" about something you see or a task you did if it gets you fired up (good or bad)! My aim is to create tests that are clear and understandable for testers. It doesn't always go perfectly, but I'm not keen on confusing people, or making you spend 30-40 minutes on something. I rate all my participants, and the only people who don't get 5 stars are the ones who clearly aren't trying at all (or the ones who obviously cheated the screener). If you have any questions about my perspective, feel free to leave a comment! I'm also open to feedback as well - I'd love to hear your thoughts about how studies can be improved for you. Thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/usertesting/comments/f0hp0j/tips_from_a_researcher/,Test Strategy

Can't Log In To App,1,6,12/21/19 5:53,"I have the User Testing app on my phone and have been going along smoothly testing on my desktop and phone for a long time. Then I bought a new tablet, and I tried to download the app and install it on my tablet. I was presented with an introduction page that would not let me log in. It ONLY asked for my email address, and I put that in and then it brings me to a page that says ""Welcome to the Dynamics panel by Microsoft - Business Applications Group"" and attempts to get me to create a new account. If I enter my information, like first name, last name and email address, etc. it tells me my PayPal email is already taken. Of course, it is taken by my account. But since I can't log into my account and it's trying to create a new one it thinks I'm inputting someone else's PayPal email. I was able to continue to do tests on my phone app though. But last week I somehow got logged out of my phone app and now I get the same screen (no way to log in). So now I can't take tests on my phone or tablet (unless I create a new account for each one I suppose... I don't really want to create that many PayPal email addresses). I tried contacting UserTesting support, both on Facebook and through the website, but their initial response was just 1) I need to enter my email and password to log in (nope) or 2) something is wrong with my password (nope). It just never asks me to log in to my account. I am hoping the long response I'm waiting on for my second email to support is because they're looking into this as an app issue and not as user error. But I was kind of shocked to not see anyone else having an issue. I didn't know there was a reddit for this so maybe someone can help me out here. I am using a file that ends in 4.21.2694.apk and I assume that might be the version number. I'm using a Samsung Tab A and Samsung Galaxy Phone. I took a photo of the log in screen than I get here: https://postimg.cc/ZB8JHbPM The the next page after I put in my email that asks for information looks like this: https://postimg.cc/4n18cYHh That's where it is trying to set up an account rather than log me in. Maybe there is an older version of the app I could use? But then if I remember correctly they used to make me update before I could take tests, so I think really it just needs to be updated.

Technical issues with Usertesting - recorder button with 15 minute countdown not working for me,1,2,12/21/19 2:29,"I sent an email to Usertesting but I just wanted to know if anyone else was having the same issues.

Let's share ackward/funny/annoying things that happened to you while you were doing a tester on Usertesting or a similar site,6,14,12/13/19 6:49,"I thought I would lighten up the mood a bit. I've been doing Usertesting since August and I really enjoy it. I always make sure that I am in a very quiet area where I cannot be disturbed while I am doing the testers or the live chats. Some of these testers are also done at all times of the day even during the middle of the night. There have been instances where no matter how hard I tried, I still could not contain the noise that was coming from elsewhere. For instance, at the beginning, I used to always forget to remove my phone from the computer room while I was doing testers because sure enough I would get a telemarketing call during that time (my bank kept calling to sell me products). I learned to put the phone far away from my computer room which has a door that I can close because it was happening so often. It even happened in the middle of a Live Conversation on Zoom but I apologized and the client did not hold it against me. Another thing I have to do when I suddenly qualify for a tester is to shoo my cats out of the computer room. I have four cats and thankfully Usertesting has a timer before you can start recording because I have to do a quick look around and remove the cats from this location very quickly and they are not too pleased with me (they hang on real tight to this really comfy chair with their claws). A few weeks ago, I had just removed one of my cats from this very particular chair where he was sleeping soundly. It was in the middle of the night and I had just qualified for a tester. My male cat who hardly even moews (the other ones do) decided to start clawing really loudly at my door and meowing like his life depended on it. I was just in the middle of this tester so I had to apologize and tell them that I had to let the cat in the room because he took that one and only time to ""express"" himself loudly at that particular moment. I was so worried that they would hold it against me but they didn't. Also had people knock really loudly at my door and the neighbour decide that 9PM is the right time to start running his chainsaw while I was doing a tester. I did mention it to the client while I was doing the tester and moved on. None of these things were held against me. Just for fun, I am just wondering if you could share any times when you were doing a tester or a live conversation and had ackward/funny/annoying things happen to you.

Duplicate screeners,3,17,11/5/19 9:16,Anyone else feel like UT should be better about sending duplicate screeners? I realize itâ€™s a first come first served platform but I got dinged recently for taking a test twice...and it wasnâ€™t a test! It was a one question screener than took you to a Mailchimp survey. I didnâ€™t even know it was a duplicate screener because sometimes they seem similar but then theyâ€™re totally different and you qualify for one version of the screener but not another. I was presented with a message â€œyouâ€™ve already taken this surveyâ€ and didnâ€™t even know that a $10 payment was posted. Received an email from UT today telling me itâ€™s against the rules and they knocked my rating down a bit because of it. I really donâ€™t feel like my 4.9 rating should take a hit when all I did was answer their screener. How about donâ€™t publish screeners Iâ€™ve already answered to my account! UT for almost 5 years.

a warning regarding validately's moderated tests,11,4,11/1/19 4:57,"validately has a HUGE security issue. if you have a mod test and the researcher is still live with the previous participant, you will be able to see and hear both once you click your link. i was able to see the last 3 minutes of another participant's camera (though not see his screen nor interact with them). when i was my time i told the researcher and he said he was going to report this to validately. i had my test (30 min) normally without issues then. the problem is that the researcher contacted validately and told them my answers might have been biased due to the issue. so basically the researcher stabbed me behind the back, took my answers and attempted to get another participant while not paying for my time. validately took this as an offense (from me!) and banned me from the platform due to ""non-professionalism conduct"" on my behalf. in reality, i got banned because i made the company look bad due to this severe security flaw. however the next day they said that they would pay me anyway (after saying that they wouldn't) and after a week of emails or twitter i got unbanned but they didn't acknowledge that this was entirely their fault, instead just saying that they take their researcher's complaints very seriously. so, TL;DR if you have a mod test and you join and experience this, they want you to IMMEDIATELY close the tab without speaking/writing anything on the chat. the problem is that if you see someone on the webcam, you have no way to know if they are the researcher or another participant.",https://www.reddit.com/r/usertesting/comments/dpttzq/a_warning_regarding_validatelys_moderated_tests/,Other Company

[Update] Has anyone completed a test with userfeel?,2,6,10/2/19 23:41,"[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/usertesting/comments/d9pj0d/has_anyone_completed_a_test_with_userfeel/) Since we don't get many tests on Userfeel i am updating my experience in case others are interested. So i had 5 tests last week on the 25th that had been pending the whole time until 10 minutes ago when they were approved (8 days in total). They have two ratings it seems, one from the client and one from Userfeel themselves. Not sure of why it takes 8 days to get approved, whether the client just had not seen them until now or if Userfeel wait to approve it themselves after giving the client the test. Just not sure to be honest. Another interesting thing is that once it's approved the money goes into a wallet in your dashboard where you manually withdraw it yourself. They give you the option to withdraw to Visa Debit card, Amazon gift card or simply your Paypal account, which i thought was pretty good to be honest. All in all, it's a bit of a different process to the other UX sites out there i've used, but not too bad of an experience, just a bit of uncertainty while you wait to see if your tests get approved or not. TrymyUi is somewhat similar how they approve your test first before giving it to the client, but from my experience they only take about an hour to approve them, much less 8 days with userfeel.

"Single test, 193 tasks. New record?",12,10,9/28/19 6:28,"Courtesy of Capital One. Starting with one of the obnoxious screener types wanting to know: * my gender * my role in household financial decision making * whether or not I'd participated in a focus group or one-on-one interview in the past six months * whether or not I worked in certain disqualifying industries (ie. marketing) * whether or not I have a credit card * who it's from * how much I charge to it every month * whether or not I pay it off in full every month * whether or not I'm comfortable with my current balance * what my credit score is From there, I'm offered the test where it is explained to me that they are looking for feedback on e-mails that they send to customers. ""10 e-mails with 20 questions on each, some of which will require you to explain your answer."" I guess in all fairness they did warn that it would take 45-60 minutes for the test. What it didn't do was offer a bonus for completion of the over-long tedium, and my experience has been that whatever estimate you're given for how long someone thinks it might take for you to do a 'survey' like that, triple it and that's about the minimum it's really going to take. (Unless you're rushing, not reading questions properly, and generally not doing a good job.) I stopped to consider whether I wanted to do the test and then follow up with UT for increased payment, but then I realized that for that kind of test, it could go the exact opposite way. Imagine I only get through half the test when I run out of time and end up with a 1- or 2-star rating for not completing it. As a matter of principle, I don't let people take advantage of me, and I don't put myself in a position where I end up worse off for doing what is asked of me within the restrictions imposed by someone else. I feel as though they're putting more attention into how to write a good e-mail than they did in their security systems. For 193 tasks on a 1 hour time limit and no promise of a bonus, about all I'd be willing to do for them is let them kiss my ass. (In general, I don't name names when discussing a test, but this one felt borderline abusive and I think a certain amount of shame attached to the company is warranted.)",https://www.reddit.com/r/usertesting/comments/da6uhj/single_test_193_tasks_new_record/,Bad Test

Conversion Crimes Update.,9,47,9/25/19 22:59,"There is a video under Updates if you already have an account, but here is a summary for those people who didn't get in during the open registrations. [https://conversioncrimes.com](https://conversioncrimes.com) &#x200B; First off, they are shooting for a November go-live. They mentioned that they are a very small team of only 8 people and they have another company that is actually their main focus right now, so please be patient. Next they talked about opening up registrations because they need more testers with some specific skills and also because once you take a test for a domain, you can't take the test again if it's been tweaked. They said that they are **not** going to implement any type of screener system at all, but if there are special requirements listed, they expect us to follow those and only take tests we are qualified to take. If you take tests you are not qualified to take and the client complains, there will be consequences. If you do it often, you could lose your account or at the very least get a low rating or not get paid for the test at all. They also talked about having more in-depth and higher paying tests in the future. Something that takes a lot more effort, but also pays more. Then they talked about opening up other avenues for us to earn, like helping them moderate tests. That would entail listening/watching to tests other testers have completed and looking at 5 star tests to see if they warrant a bonus, or tests rated less than two stars, you'd see if it warranted that rating. Obviously this would only be for people who had an aptitude for it and proved the ability to do this task. They also said we could possibly become test writers. When they let us test the other side of it a couple of months ago, they were surprised by how good some of our tests were.

Do customers look at what you selected qualification at all?,1,5,8/18/19 9:20,"Sometimes I do my test, clearly did not select an item that I do not have. I go to the test, and it's all about asking my feedback on an item I do not have (asking how often I use it, if I can show the details and etc). So qualification seems not always been tested or looked at compared to the actual test, also evidently from some pics here (likes ones that did not do their qualification vetting and says ""select this to move on""). So the question is, do you know if the customers care what you select or do they only view your video? Because a lot of times, selection criteria seems so arbitrary or irrelevant to the actual test",https://www.reddit.com/r/usertesting/comments/cru8o6/do_customers_look_at_what_you_selected/,Screener

Some Generic Tips for Usability Testing,20,16,8/17/19 2:58,"I thought I'd offer a few tips for those people just starting out. These are just generic tips for usability testing in general and **not** for any specific site. Also, these tips aren't the **ONLY** way to do testing, it's just the way I do it. It's probably common sense to some people too. I have been doing usability testing for a few years now, but got into it pretty heavy about two years ago. I seem to be pretty good at it and I really enjoy doing it. Here is the header from my [usertesting.com](https://usertesting.com) ledger. [https://imgur.com/mz6y07p](https://imgur.com/mz6y07p) I have a 4.9 rating currently. It does go down once in a while and it's been perfect too, but I am always between 4.7 and 5.0. There are 25 completed tests per page and you can see I have 17 pages of completed tests. My last page is almost full, so I am just under 425 total tests done, although some of the moderated and special tests were never in my ledger at all, so I am actually close to 440 completed tests on that site alone... I test for all the other big sites too, so my total usability tests are somewhere around 700. I just offer this info to show that I do have some experience in testing and you can trust what I say to at least work for me. I'm sure there are people with more experience than me and I hope they will offer up some tips here too. 1. **Be honest!** I can't stress this enough. Don't try and say what you think they want to hear. Give honest feedback. if you don't like something, tell them. Don't try and take tests you really aren't qualified to take too. 2. **Be polite!** I always try to put myself in the mind set that I am talking to a good friend about this stuff. I also try and smile while I am doing it. Obviously they can't see you, but I think it comes across in your voice. These people listen to a lot of strangers talking and a monotone/grumpy ass voice can turn them off, even if the person is offering good feedback. 3. **Pay attention!** Read and re-read the instructions out loud. Make sure you understand perfectly what they are asking you. If you don't understand what they are asking, say so and then say ""This is what I \*think\* you mean"" and give feedback on what you think they are asking. Take your time. Never try and speed through the test. The test should be the ONLY thing you are doing too. I once talked to somebody who was upset they received a bad rating on a test, but it was warranted because they were **EATING** while taking the test, lol. 4. **Environment!** Create a space to test in and make it comfortable. Being comfortable also comes across in your voice, more than you would think. Find someplace where you won't be bothered or interrupted in your test. Clients will often give you a low rating if there is a lot of distractions or extra noises in your test audio. Which leads me to my next topic... 5. **Equipment!** When I first started out I was using the internal mic on a laptop. It was ""ok"" most of the time, but I had one client who couldn't understand me at all. It was the only time I ever received a bad rating and [Usertesting.com](https://Usertesting.com) agreed with them. They made me prove the issue was fixed before they let me do any more tests. I bought a mid-range Razer headset and never had issues with sound again. The quality of your audio and video can make or break you. You don't have to spend a ton, but get something half way decent. There is a site who asks you NOT to use a headset though... Userlytics asks that you do not for desktop tests. They said it can somehow interfere, but I have always used a headset with them and have had no issues with sound. YMMV &#x200B; So hopefully these are some helpful hints. I want to reiterate that these tips aren't rules. They are just things that have worked for me and I seem to be pretty successful at usability testing. Each of the sites have their own quirks and rules to follow, so make sure you understand the difference in each place. You also need to find your ""style"" and what works for you the best, for example, I always introduce myself very quickly at the beginning of the test Like *""Hey there, this is Rikostan for* [*Validately.com*](https://Validately.com)*""* only I use my real name. I know a lot of people wouldn't want to use their real name in the test, but it doesn't bother me at all and I feel like it starts off the test on the right foot. &#x200B; Anybody else have some general tips to add? It would be awesome to turn this into a thread for newbies to help them learn how to offer the best feedback possible and get up to speed quickly. &#x200B; &#x200B; {EDIT} I forgot I wanted to also put up a great resource for testers. The /r/beermoney sub has a discord server. [https://discord.gg/bEJq8TX](https://discord.gg/bEJq8TX) There is a channel called ""Tasks"" there that has a ton of great info about Usability testing and other forms of online jobs.

"Still can't land a single test on the PC, what do you think?",7,25,8/13/19 15:35,"Okay, so i have a good rating now so i'm get quite a few screeners on my busiest days (tuesday - friday). I work from home, so i'm literally at the computer all day so i'm able to click on the screener the second i hear the ding. However, every screener i pass on the PC all result in ""All responses recorded"" no matter how quick i complete the screener. Every. Single. One. All of the time. I only ever get tests on my mobile. What i found interesting though is after i get the 'All responses recorded' message and go back to the dashboard, the test is there and it still gives the option to either decline or take the test. Not ""take screener"", it says ""view test"" and takes you to the test, though still stays all responses recorded. These usually hang around for an hour or so in the dashboard. Here is a [screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/f6K5L08) from today of three screeners i passed yet remain in the dashboard after i get the ""All responses recorded"" message. What's more interesting is, i got a mobile phone screener show up on the PC dashboard, opened UT app, wouldn't let me continue until i had downloaded and installed the newest usertesting dashboard. I was then able to take the screener which had the exact same questions as one of the screeners i passed on the PC. So even after loading up UT on my phone, having to install the new version, re-opening the app, taking the screener with the same questions, i was able to get the test on the mobile, yet i still can't get a single test on the PC no matter how quick i click it.

"5 pages of tests all disappeared, now there's nothing?",1,9,8/1/19 22:23,"I always have a bunch of available tests and since I don't delete the ones I'm not interested in (ex. if it says I must be a user of some obscure software) they all pile up, so at any given moment I usually have like three pages worth of available tests. Yesterday I finished a test and when it sent me back to the home page, there was absolutely nothing. It's been stuck on a ""Welcome! We look forward to hearing what you have to say. Keep this page open and listen for the ding that tells you we have a new opportunity for you."" for probably 15 hours at this point. I'm a pretty active user and my rating is good and it's really unusual for me to have nothing. Especially since I don't know where all those other tests that I'd been ignoring would have gone.

I really did feel i completed the test at very reasonable speed and in no way was i trying to be flaky by reporting it. Usertesting got back to me today, upon reviewing the test they were very nice and thanked me for letting them know and paid me additional compensation to reflect the extra time it took($10).

So I sent another email Thursday and havenâ€™t heard back yet. Iâ€™m wondering how I should handle this because Iâ€™ve done tests since and have been paid so the issue is obv this single test. The crazy part is that this was a live test and I thought I did fine on it but now Iâ€™m wondering if I messed up since it hasnâ€™t even shown up that I completed it. Any advice is appreciated.

"Any Australians here? As an Aussie myself, i was just curios how many screeners you get with usertesting and others?",2,9,7/22/19 23:45,"I was hoping to compare amount of screeners with regards to similar demographics in Aus? I'm early 30's, male, married, work full time, dog, cat etc I'm at the computer all day so i see pretty much see every screener come in. Last week after getting my first test with usertesting passed, my screeners went crazy, i counted 104 screeners in total last week. I got one interview out of those screeners the rest i DQ'd on. I did pick up one mobile test a couple days ago, but it didn't have a screener so i guess i was just lucky. But since that last mobile test (got rated 5 stars, i have 4.5 avg now), the screeners dropped off dramatically, i understand the weekends are slow, but today i never got one screener at all after being so busy with them last week. I've had a similar experiences with TryMyUi and Validately. Before completing my first test with TryMyUi,i had lots of screeners, after my first test(4 stars) they just stopped. Same with validately, got a screener every hour with them until i done my first two tests (got them the same day), screeners went from every hour to maybe one a day, now i don't get any at all for maybe the last 1.5 - 2 weeks. I thought i must have bombed the screeners so i contacted them to ask and they said i had a really good rating and probably the tests just don't fit my demographics. But then how come i was getting a screener every hour prior? Userfeel, i did the qualifier and scored a 5/5 but my overall rating was 2.5, so i was never getting tests. I emailed them to ask about the 2.5 rating and they said it was a mistake and adjusted it to 5/5. Still now having a 5/5 overall rating i have never received a screener to date. userlytics, nothing ever. Intellzoon, nothing ever. Userbrain, nothing ever.
